# Psalm 87 

Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm. A Song.

**¹** This house is resting on the holy mountain.

**²** The Lord has more love for the doors of Zion than for all the tents of Jacob.

**³** Noble things are said of you, O town of God. (Selah.)

**⁴** Rahab and Babylon will be named among those who have knowledge of me; see, Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man had his birth there.

**⁵** And of Zion it will be said, This or that man had his birth there; and the Most High will make her strong.

**⁶** The Lord will keep in mind, when he is writing the records of the people, that this man had his birth there. (Selah.)

**⁷** The players on instruments will be there, and the dancers will say, All my springs are in you.
