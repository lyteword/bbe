# Psalm 122

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. Of David. I was glad because they said to me, We will go into the house of the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> At last our feet were inside your doors, O Jerusalem. 

<sup>3</sup> O Jerusalem, you are like a town which is well joined together; 

<sup>4</sup> To which the tribes went up, even the tribes of the Lord, for a witness to Israel, to give praise to the name of the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> For there seats for the judges were placed, even the rulers' seats of the line of David. 

<sup>6</sup> O make prayers for the peace of Jerusalem; may they whose love is given to you do well. 

<sup>7</sup> May peace be inside your walls, and wealth in your noble houses. 

<sup>8</sup> Because of my brothers and friends, I will now say, Let peace be with you. 

<sup>9</sup> Because of the house of the Lord our God, I will be working for your good.
