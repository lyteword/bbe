# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The wise sayings of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> To have knowledge of wise teaching; to be clear about the words of reason: 

<sup>3</sup> To be trained in the ways of wisdom, in righteousness and judging truly and straight behaviour: 

<sup>4</sup> To make the simple-minded sharp, and to give the young man knowledge, and serious purpose: 

<sup>5</sup> (The wise man, hearing, will get greater learning, and the acts of the man of good sense will be wisely guided:) 

<sup>6</sup> To get the sense of wise sayings and secrets, and of the words of the wise and their dark sayings. 

<sup>7</sup> The fear of the Lord is the start of knowledge: but the foolish have no use for wisdom and teaching. 

<sup>8</sup> My son, give ear to the training of your father, and do not give up the teaching of your mother: 

<sup>9</sup> For they will be a crown of grace for your head, and chain-ornaments about your neck. 

<sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners would take you out of the right way, do not go with them. 

<sup>11</sup> If they say, Come with us; let us make designs against the good, waiting secretly for the upright, without cause; 

<sup>12</sup> Let us overcome them living, like the underworld, and in their strength, as those who go down to death; 

<sup>13</sup> Goods of great price will be ours, our houses will be full of wealth; 

<sup>14</sup> Take your chance with us, and we will all have one money-bag: 

<sup>15</sup> My son, do not go with them; keep your feet from their ways: 

<sup>16</sup> For their feet are running after evil, and they are quick to take a man's life. 

<sup>17</sup> Truly, to no purpose is the net stretched out before the eyes of the bird: 

<sup>18</sup> And they are secretly waiting for their blood and making ready destruction for themselves. 

<sup>19</sup> Such is the fate of everyone who goes in search of profit; it takes away the life of its owners. 

<sup>20</sup> Wisdom is crying out in the street; her voice is loud in the open places; 

<sup>21</sup> Her words are sounding in the meeting-places, and in the doorways of the town: 

<sup>22</sup> How long, you simple ones, will foolish things be dear to you? and pride a delight to the haters of authority? how long will the foolish go on hating knowledge? 

<sup>23</sup> Be turned again by my sharp words: see, I will send the flow of my spirit on you, and make my words clear to you. 

<sup>24</sup> Because your ears were shut to my voice; no one gave attention to my out-stretched hand; 

<sup>25</sup> You were not controlled by my guiding, and would have nothing to do with my sharp words: 

<sup>26</sup> So in the day of your trouble I will be laughing; I will make sport of your fear; 

<sup>27</sup> When your fear comes on you like a storm, and your trouble like a rushing wind; when pain and sorrow come on you. 

<sup>28</sup> Then I will give no answer to their cries; searching for me early, they will not see me: 

<sup>29</sup> For they were haters of knowledge, and did not give their hearts to the fear of the Lord: 

<sup>30</sup> They had no desire for my teaching, and my words of protest were as nothing to them. 

<sup>31</sup> So the fruit of their way will be their food, and with the designs of their hearts they will be made full. 

<sup>32</sup> For the turning back of the simple from teaching will be the cause of their death, and the peace of the foolish will be their destruction. 

<sup>33</sup> But whoever gives ear to me will take his rest safely, living in peace without fear of evil.
