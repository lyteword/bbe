# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Christ has truly made us free: then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again.

<sup>2</sup> See, I Paul say to you, that if you undergo circumcision, Christ will be of no use to you.

<sup>3</sup> Yes, I give witness again to every man who undergoes circumcision, that he will have to keep all the law.

<sup>4</sup> You are cut off from Christ, you who would have righteousness by the law; you are turned away from grace.

<sup>5</sup> For we through the Spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness.

<sup>6</sup> Because in Christ Jesus, having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit; but only faith working through love.

<sup>7</sup> You were going on well; who was the cause of your not giving ear to what is true?

<sup>8</sup> This ready belief did not come from him who had made you his.

<sup>9</sup> A little leaven makes a change in all the mass.

<sup>10</sup> I am certain about you in the Lord, that you will be of no other mind; but he who is troubling you will have his punishment, whoever he is.

<sup>11</sup> But I, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still attacked? then has the shame of the cross been taken away.

<sup>12</sup> My desire is that they who give you trouble might even be cut off themselves.

<sup>13</sup> Because you, brothers, were marked out to be free; only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance, but through love be servants one to another.

<sup>14</sup> For all the law is made complete in one word, even in this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself.

<sup>15</sup> But if you are given to fighting with one another, take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another.

<sup>16</sup> But I say, Go on in the Spirit, and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh.

<sup>17</sup> For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; because these are opposite the one to the other; so that you may not do the things which you have a mind to do.

<sup>18</sup> But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

<sup>19</sup> Now the works of the flesh are clear, which are these: evil desire, unclean things, wrong use of the senses,

<sup>20</sup> Worship of images, use of strange powers, hates, fighting, desire for what another has, angry feelings, attempts to get the better of others, divisions, false teachings,

<sup>21</sup> Envy, uncontrolled drinking and feasting, and such things: of which I give you word clearly, even as I did in the past, that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of God.

<sup>22</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, a quiet mind, kind acts, well-doing, faith,

<sup>23</sup> Gentle behaviour, control over desires: against such there is no law.

<sup>24</sup> And those who are Christ's have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires.

<sup>25</sup> If we are living by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us be guided.

<sup>26</sup> Let us not be full of self-glory, making one another angry, having envy of one another.
