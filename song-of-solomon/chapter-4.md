# Chapter 4

**¹** See, you are fair, my love, you are fair; you have the eyes of a dove; your hair is as a flock of goats, which take their rest on the side of Gilead.

**²** Your teeth are like a flock of sheep whose wool is newly cut, which come up from the washing; every one has two lambs, and there is not one without young.

**³** Your red lips are like a bright thread, and your mouth is fair of form; the sides of your head are like pomegranate fruit under your veil.

**⁴** Your neck is like the tower of David made for a store-house of arms, in which a thousand breastplates are hanging, breastplates for fighting-men.

**⁵** Your two breasts are like two young roes of the same birth, which take their food among the lilies.

**⁶** Till the evening comes, and the sky slowly becomes dark, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

**⁷** You are all fair, my love; there is no mark on you.

**⁸** Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon; see from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the places of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.

**⁹** You have taken away my heart, my sister, my bride; you have taken away my heart, with one look you have taken it, with one chain of your neck!

**¹⁰** How fair is your love, my sister! How much better is your love than wine, and the smell of your oils than any perfume!

**¹¹** Your lips are dropping honey; honey and milk are under your tongue; and the smell of your clothing is like the smell of Lebanon.

**¹²** A garden walled-in is my sister, my bride; a garden shut up, a spring of water stopped.

**¹³** The produce of the garden is pomegranates; with all the best fruits, henna and spikenard,

**¹⁴** Spikenard and safron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.

**¹⁵** You are a fountain of gardens, a spring of living waters, and flowing waters from Lebanon.

**¹⁶** Be awake, O north wind; and come, O south, blowing on my garden, so that its spices may come out. Let my loved one come into his garden, and take of his good fruits.
