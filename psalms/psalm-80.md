# Psalm 80

To the chief music-maker; put to Shoshannim-eduth. Of Asaph. A Psalm.

**¹** Give ear, O Keeper of Israel, guiding Joseph like a flock; you who have your seat on the winged ones, let your glory be seen.

**²** Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, let your strength be awake from sleep, and come as our salvation.

**³** Take us back again, O God; let us see the shining of your face, and let us be safe.

**⁴** O Lord God of armies, how long will your wrath be burning against the rest of your people?

**⁵** You have given them the bread of weeping for food; for their drink you have given them sorrow in great measure.

**⁶** You make us a cause of war among our neighbours; our haters are laughing at us among themselves.

**⁷** Take us back again, O God of armies; let us see the shining of your face, and let us be safe.

**⁸** You took a vine out of Egypt: driving out the nations, and planting it in their land.

**⁹** You made ready a place for it, so that it might take deep root, and it sent out its branches over all the land.

**¹⁰** The mountains were covered with its shade, and the great trees with its branches.

**¹¹** It sent out its arms to the Sea, and its branches to the River.

**¹²** Why are its walls broken down by your hands, so that all who go by may take its fruit?

**¹³** It is uprooted by the pigs from the woods, the beasts of the field get their food from it.

**¹⁴** Come back, O God of armies: from heaven let your eyes be turned to this vine, and give your mind to it,

**¹⁵** Even to the tree which was planted by your right hand, and to the branch which you made strong for yourself.

**¹⁶** It is burned with fire; it is cut down: they are made waste by the wrath of your face.

**¹⁷** Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.

**¹⁸** So will we not be turned back from you; keep us in life, and we will give praise to your name.

**¹⁹** Take us back, O Lord God of armies; let us see the shining of your face, and let us be safe.
