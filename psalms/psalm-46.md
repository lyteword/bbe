# Psalm 46

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. Of the sons of Korah; put to Alamoth. A Song. God is our harbour and our strength, a very present help in trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> For this cause we will have no fear, even though the earth is changed, and though the mountains are moved in the heart of the sea; 

<sup>3</sup> Though its waters are sounding and troubled, and though the mountains are shaking with their violent motion. (Selah.) 

<sup>4</sup> There is a river whose streams make glad the resting-place of God, the holy place of the tents of the Most High. 

<sup>5</sup> God has taken his place in her; she will not be moved: he will come to her help at the dawn of morning. 

<sup>6</sup> The nations were angry, the kingdoms were moved; at the sound of his voice the earth became like wax. 

<sup>7</sup> The Lord of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our high tower. (Selah.) 

<sup>8</sup> Come, see the works of the Lord, the destruction which he has made in the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> He puts an end to wars over all the earth; by him the bow is broken, and the spear cut in two, and the carriage burned in the fire. 

<sup>10</sup> Be at peace in the knowledge that I am God: I will be lifted up among the nations, I will be honoured through all the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> The Lord of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our high tower. (Selah.)
