# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Then Job made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> How have you given help to him who has no power! how have you been the salvation of the arm which has no strength! 

<sup>3</sup> How have you given teaching to him who has no wisdom, and fully made clear true knowledge! 

<sup>4</sup> To whom have your words been said? and whose spirit came out from you? 

<sup>5</sup> The shades in the underworld are shaking; the waters and those living in them. 

<sup>6</sup> The underworld is uncovered before him, and Destruction has no veil. 

<sup>7</sup> By his hand the north is stretched out in space, and the earth is hanging on nothing. 

<sup>8</sup> By him the waters are shut up in his thick clouds, and the cloud does not give way under them. 

<sup>9</sup> By him the face of his high seat is veiled, and his cloud stretched out over it. 

<sup>10</sup> By him a circle is marked out on the face of the waters, to the limits of the light and the dark. 

<sup>11</sup> The pillars of heaven are shaking, and are overcome by his sharp words. 

<sup>12</sup> By his power the sea was made quiet; and by his wisdom Rahab was wounded. 

<sup>13</sup> By his wind the heavens become bright: by his hand the quickly moving snake was cut through. 

<sup>14</sup> See, these are only the outskirts of his ways; and how small is that which comes to our ears about him! But the thunder of his acts of power is outside all knowledge.
