# Psalm 21

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David. The king will be glad in your strength, O Lord; how great will be his delight in your salvation! 

<sup>2</sup> You have given him his heart's desire, and have not kept back the request of his lips. (Selah.) 

<sup>3</sup> For you go before him with the blessings of good things: you put a crown of fair gold on his head. 

<sup>4</sup> He made request to you for life, and you gave it to him, long life for ever and ever. 

<sup>5</sup> His glory is great in your salvation: honour and authority have you put on him. 

<sup>6</sup> For you have made him a blessing for ever: you have given him joy in the light of your face. 

<sup>7</sup> For the king has faith in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High he will not be moved. 

<sup>8</sup> Your hand will make a search for all your haters; your right hand will be hard on all those who are against you. 

<sup>9</sup> You will make them like a flaming oven before you; the Lord in his wrath will put an end to them, and they will be burned up in the fire. 

<sup>10</sup> Their fruit will be cut off from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 

<sup>11</sup> For their thoughts were bitter against you: they had an evil design in their minds, which they were not able to put into effect. 

<sup>12</sup> Their backs will be turned when you make ready the cords of your bow against their faces. 

<sup>13</sup> Be lifted up, O Lord, in your strength; so will we make songs in praise of your power.
