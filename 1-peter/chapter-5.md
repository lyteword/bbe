# Chapter 5

**¹** I who am myself one of the rulers of the church, and a witness of the death of Christ, having my part in the coming glory, send this serious request to the chief men among you:

**²** Keep watch over the flock of God which is in your care, using your authority, not as forced to do so, but gladly; and not for unclean profit but with a ready mind;

**³** Not as lords over God's heritage, but making yourselves examples to the flock.

**⁴** And at the coming of the chief Keeper of the sheep, you will be given the eternal crown of glory.

**⁵** And in the same way, let the younger men be ruled by the older ones. Let all of you put away pride and make yourselves ready to be servants: for God is a hater of pride, but he gives grace to those who make themselves low.

**⁶** For this cause make yourselves low under the strong hand of God, so that when the time comes you may be lifted up;

**⁷** Putting all your troubles on him, for he takes care of you.

**⁸** Be serious and keep watch; the Evil One, who is against you, goes about like a lion with open mouth in search of food;

**⁹** Do not give way to him but be strong in your faith, in the knowledge that your brothers who are in the world undergo the same troubles.

**¹⁰** And after you have undergone pain for a little time, the God of all grace who has given you a part in his eternal glory through Christ Jesus, will himself give you strength and support, and make you complete in every good thing;

**¹¹** His is the power for ever. So be it.

**¹²** I have sent you this short letter by Silvanus, a true brother, in my opinion; comforting you and witnessing that this is the true grace of God; keep to it.

**¹³** She who is in Babylon, who has a part with you in the purpose of God, sends you her love; and so does my son Mark.

**¹⁴** Give one another the kiss of love. Peace be to you all in Christ.
