# Psalm 25 

Of David.

**¹** To you, O Lord, my soul is lifted up.

**²** O my God, I have put my faith in you, let me not be shamed; let not my haters be glorying over me.

**³** Let no servant of yours be put to shame; may those be shamed who are false without cause.

**⁴** Make your steps clear to me, O Lord; give me knowledge of your ways.

**⁵** Be my guide and teacher in the true way; for you are the God of my salvation; I am waiting for your word all the day.

**⁶** O Lord, keep in mind your pity and your mercies; for they have been from the earliest times.

**⁷** Do not keep in mind my sins when I was young, or my wrongdoing: let your memory of me be full of mercy, O Lord, because of your righteousness.

**⁸** Good and upright is the Lord: so he will be the teacher of sinners in the way.

**⁹** He will be an upright guide to the poor in spirit: he will make his way clear to them.

**¹⁰** All the ways of the Lord are mercy and good faith for those who keep his agreement and his witness.

**¹¹** Because of your name, O Lord, let me have forgiveness for my sin, which is very great.

**¹²** If a man has the fear of the Lord, the Lord will be his teacher in the way of his pleasure.

**¹³** His soul will be full of good things, and his seed will have the earth for its heritage.

**¹⁴** The secret of the Lord is with those in whose hearts is the fear of him; he will make his agreement clear to them.

**¹⁵** My eyes are turned to the Lord at all times; for he will take my feet out of the net.

**¹⁶** Be turned to me, and have mercy on me; for I am troubled and have no helper.

**¹⁷** The troubles of my heart are increased: O take me out of my sorrows.

**¹⁸** Give thought to my grief and my pain; and take away all my sins.

**¹⁹** See how those who are against me are increased, for bitter is their hate of me.

**²⁰** O keep my soul, and take me out of danger: let me not be shamed, for I have put my faith in you.

**²¹** For my clean and upright ways keep me safe, because my hope is in you.

**²²** Give Israel salvation, O God, out of all his troubles.
