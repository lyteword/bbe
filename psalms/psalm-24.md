# Psalm 24

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Of David. The earth is the Lord's, with all its wealth; the world and all the people living in it. 

<sup>2</sup> For by him it was based on the seas, and made strong on the deep rivers. 

<sup>3</sup> Who may go up into the hill of the Lord? and who may come into his holy place? 

<sup>4</sup> He who has clean hands and a true heart; whose desire has not gone out to foolish things, who has not taken a false oath. 

<sup>5</sup> He will have blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 

<sup>6</sup> This is the generation of those whose hearts are turned to you, even to your face, O God of Jacob. (Selah.) 

<sup>7</sup> Let your heads be lifted up, O doors; be lifted up, O you eternal doors: that the King of glory may come in. 

<sup>8</sup> Who is the King of glory? The Lord of strength and power, the Lord strong in war. 

<sup>9</sup> Let your heads be lifted up, O doors; let them be lifted up, O you eternal doors: that the King of glory may come in. 

<sup>10</sup> Who is the King of glory? The Lord of armies, he is the King of glory. (Selah.)
