# Psalm 48

<sup>1</sup> A Song. A Psalm. Of the sons of Korah. Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised, in the town of our God, in his holy mountain. 

<sup>2</sup> Beautiful in its high position, the joy of all the earth, is the mountain of Zion, the mountain of God, the town of the great King. 

<sup>3</sup> In its buildings God is seen to be a high tower. 

<sup>4</sup> For see! the kings came together by agreement, they were joined together. 

<sup>5</sup> They saw it, and so were full of wonder; they were troubled, and went quickly away in fear. 

<sup>6</sup> Shaking came on them and pain, as on a woman in childbirth. 

<sup>7</sup> By you the ships of Tarshish are broken as by an east wind. 

<sup>8</sup> As it came to our ears so have we seen it, in the town of the Lord of armies, in the town of our God; God will keep it fixed for ever. (Selah.) 

<sup>9</sup> Our thoughts were of your mercy, O God, while we were in your Temple. 

<sup>10</sup> As your name is, O God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth; your right hand is full of righteousness. 

<sup>11</sup> Let there be joy in the mountain of Zion, and let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of your wise decisions. 

<sup>12</sup> Make your way about Zion, and go round it, numbering its towers. 

<sup>13</sup> Take note of its strong walls, looking well at its fair buildings; so that you may give word of it to the generation which comes after. 

<sup>14</sup> Because this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide.
