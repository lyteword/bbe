# Psalm 49

Alamoth. To the chief music-maker. Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm.

<sup>1</sup> Give attention to this, all you peoples; let your ears be open, all you who are living in the world.

<sup>2</sup> High and low together, the poor, and those who have wealth.

<sup>3</sup> From my mouth will come words of wisdom; and in the thoughts of my heart will be knowledge.

<sup>4</sup> I will put my teaching into a story; I will make my dark sayings clear with music.

<sup>5</sup> What cause have I for fear in the days of evil, when the evil-doing of those who are working for my downfall is round about me?

<sup>6</sup> Even of those whose faith is in their wealth, and whose hearts are lifted up because of their stores.

<sup>7</sup> Truly, no man may get back his soul for a price, or give to God the payment for himself;

<sup>8</sup> (Because it takes a great price to keep his soul from death, and man is not able to give it.)

<sup>9</sup> So that he might have eternal life, and never see the underworld.

<sup>10</sup> For he sees that wise men come to their end, and foolish persons of low behaviour come to destruction together, letting their wealth go to others.

<sup>11</sup> The place of the dead is their house for ever, and their resting-place through all generations; those who come after them give their names to their lands.

<sup>12</sup> But man, like the animals, does not go on for ever; he comes to an end like the beasts.

<sup>13</sup> This is the way of the foolish; their silver is for those who come after them, and their children get the pleasure of their gold. (Selah.)

<sup>14</sup> Death will give them their food like sheep; the underworld is their fate and they will go down into it; their flesh is food for worms; their form is wasted away; the underworld is their resting-place for ever.

<sup>15</sup> But God will get back my soul; for he will take me from the power of death. (Selah.)

<sup>16</sup> Have no fear when wealth comes to a man, and the glory of his house is increased;

<sup>17</sup> For at his death, he will take nothing away; his glory will not go down after him.

<sup>18</sup> Though he might have pride in his soul in his life-time, and men will give you praise if you do well for yourself,

<sup>19</sup> He will go to the generation of his fathers; he will not see the light again.

<sup>20</sup> Man, like the animals, does not go on for ever; he comes to an end like the beasts.
