# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Beth-phage and Bethany, at the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,

<sup>2</sup> And said to them, Go into the little town opposite: and when you come to it, you will see a young ass with a cord round his neck, on which no man has ever been seated; let him loose, and come back with him.

<sup>3</sup> And if anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord has need of him and will send him back straight away.

<sup>4</sup> And they went away and saw a young ass by the door outside in the open street; and they were getting him loose.

<sup>5</sup> And some of those who were there said to them, What are you doing, taking the ass?

<sup>6</sup> And they said to them the words which Jesus had said; and they let them go.

<sup>7</sup> And they took the young ass to Jesus, and put their clothing on him, and he got on his back.

<sup>8</sup> And a great number put down their clothing in the way; and others put down branches which they had taken from the fields.

<sup>9</sup> And those who went in front, and those who came after, were crying, Glory: A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord:

<sup>10</sup> A blessing on the coming kingdom of our father David: Glory in the highest.

<sup>11</sup> And he went into Jerusalem into the Temple; and after looking round about on all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.

<sup>12</sup> And on the day after, when they had come out from Bethany, he was in need of food.

<sup>13</sup> And seeing a fig-tree in the distance with leaves, he went to see if by chance it had anything on it: and when he came to it, he saw nothing but leaves, for it was not the time for the fruit.

<sup>14</sup> And he said to it, Let no man take fruit from you for ever. And his disciples took note of his words.

<sup>15</sup> And they came to Jerusalem; and he went into the Temple, and sent out those who were trading there, overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money;

<sup>16</sup> And he would not let any man take a vessel through the Temple.

<sup>17</sup> And he gave them teaching, and said to them, Is it not in the Writings, My house is to be named a house of prayer for all the nations? but you have made it a hole of thieves.

<sup>18</sup> And it came to the ears of the chief priests and scribes, and they took thought how they might put him to death; being in fear of him, because all the people were full of wonder at his teaching.

<sup>19</sup> And every evening he went out of the town.

<sup>20</sup> And when they were going by in the morning, they saw the fig-tree dead from the roots.

<sup>21</sup> And Peter, having a memory of it, said to him, Master, see, the tree which was cursed by you is dead.

<sup>22</sup> And Jesus, answering, said to them, Have God's faith.

<sup>23</sup> Truly I say to you, Whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and be put into the sea; and has no doubt in his heart, but has faith that what he says will come about, he will have his desire.

<sup>24</sup> For this reason I say to you, Whatever you make a request for in prayer, have faith that it has been given to you, and you will have it.

<sup>25</sup> And whenever you make a prayer, let there be forgiveness in your hearts, if you have anything against anyone; so that you may have forgiveness for your sins from your Father who is in heaven.

<sup>26</sup> []

<sup>27</sup> And they came again to Jerusalem: and while he was walking in the Temple, there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority:

<sup>28</sup> And they said to him, By what authority do you do these things? or who gave you authority to do these things?

<sup>29</sup> And Jesus said to them, I will put to you one question; give me an answer, and I will say by what authority I do these things.

<sup>30</sup> The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? give me an answer.

<sup>31</sup> And they gave thought to it among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not have faith in him?

<sup>32</sup> But if we say, From men — they were in fear of the people, because all took John to be truly a prophet.

<sup>33</sup> And they said in answer to Jesus, We have no idea. And Jesus said to them, And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things.
