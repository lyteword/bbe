# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> My son, keep my teaching in your memory, and my rules in your heart: 

<sup>2</sup> For they will give you increase of days, years of life, and peace. 

<sup>3</sup> Let not mercy and good faith go from you; let them be hanging round your neck, recorded on your heart; 

<sup>4</sup> So you will have grace and a good name in the eyes of God and men. 

<sup>5</sup> Put all your hope in God, not looking to your reason for support. 

<sup>6</sup> In all your ways give ear to him, and he will make straight your footsteps. 

<sup>7</sup> Put no high value on your wisdom: let the fear of the Lord be before you, and keep yourself from evil: 

<sup>8</sup> This will give strength to your flesh, and new life to your bones. 

<sup>9</sup> Give honour to the Lord with your wealth, and with the first-fruits of all your increase: 

<sup>10</sup> So your store-houses will be full of grain, and your vessels overflowing with new wine. 

<sup>11</sup> My son, do not make your heart hard against the Lord's teaching; do not be made angry by his training: 

<sup>12</sup> For to those who are dear to him the Lord says sharp words, and makes the son in whom he has delight undergo pain. 

<sup>13</sup> Happy is the man who makes discovery of wisdom, and he who gets knowledge. 

<sup>14</sup> For trading in it is better than trading in silver, and its profit greater than bright gold. 

<sup>15</sup> She is of more value than jewels, and nothing for which you may have a desire is fair in comparison with her. 

<sup>16</sup> Long life is in her right hand, and in her left are wealth and honour. 

<sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of delight, and all her goings are peace. 

<sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to all who take her in their hands, and happy is everyone who keeps her. 

<sup>19</sup> The Lord by wisdom put in position the bases of the earth; by reason he put the heavens in their place. 

<sup>20</sup> By his knowledge the deep was parted, and dew came dropping from the skies. 

<sup>21</sup> My son, keep good sense, and do not let wise purpose go from your eyes. 

<sup>22</sup> So they will be life for your soul, and grace for your neck. 

<sup>23</sup> Then you will go safely on your way, and your feet will have no cause for slipping. 

<sup>24</sup> When you take your rest you will have no fear, and on your bed sleep will be sweet to you. 

<sup>25</sup> Have no fear of sudden danger, or of the storm which will come on evil-doers: 

<sup>26</sup> For the Lord will be your hope, and will keep your foot from being taken in the net. 

<sup>27</sup> Do not keep back good from those who have a right to it, when it is in the power of your hand to do it. 

<sup>28</sup> Say not to your neighbour, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it by you at the time. 

<sup>29</sup> Do not make evil designs against your neighbour, when he is living with you without fear. 

<sup>30</sup> Do not take up a cause at law against a man for nothing, if he has done you no wrong. 

<sup>31</sup> Have no envy of the violent man, or take any of his ways as an example. 

<sup>32</sup> For the wrong-hearted man is hated by the Lord, but he is a friend to the upright. 

<sup>33</sup> The curse of the Lord is on the house of the evil-doer, but his blessing is on the tent of the upright. 

<sup>34</sup> He makes sport of the men of pride, but he gives grace to the gentle-hearted. 

<sup>35</sup> The wise will have glory for their heritage, but shame will be the reward of the foolish.
