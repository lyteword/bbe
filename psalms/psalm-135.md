# Psalm 135

<sup>1</sup> Let the Lord be praised. O you servants of the Lord, give praise to the name of the Lord.

<sup>2</sup> You who are in the house of the Lord, and in the open spaces of the house of our God,

<sup>3</sup> Give praise to Jah, for he is good: make melody to his name, for it is pleasing.

<sup>4</sup> For the Lord has taken Jacob for himself, and Israel for his property.

<sup>5</sup> I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is greater than all other gods.

<sup>6</sup> The Lord has done whatever was pleasing to him, in heaven, and on the earth, in the seas and in all the deep waters.

<sup>7</sup> He makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth; he makes thunder-flames for the rain; he sends out the winds from his store-houses.

<sup>8</sup> He put to death the first-fruits of Egypt, of man and of beast.

<sup>9</sup> He sent signs and wonders among you, O Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his servants.

<sup>10</sup> He overcame great nations, and put strong kings to death;

<sup>11</sup> Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;

<sup>12</sup> And gave their land for a heritage, even for a heritage to Israel his people.

<sup>13</sup> O Lord, your name is eternal; and the memory of you will have no end.

<sup>14</sup> For the Lord will be judge of his people's cause; his feelings will be changed to his servants.

<sup>15</sup> The images of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

<sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but no voice, they have eyes, but they do not see;

<sup>17</sup> They have ears, but no hearing; and there is no breath in their mouths.

<sup>18</sup> Those who make them are like them; and so is everyone who puts his hope in them.

<sup>19</sup> Give praise to the Lord, O children of Israel: give praise to the Lord, O sons of Aaron:

<sup>20</sup> Give praise to the Lord, O sons of Levi: let all the worshippers of the Lord give him praise.

<sup>21</sup> Praise be to the Lord out of Zion, even to the Lord whose house is in Jerusalem, Let the Lord be praised.
