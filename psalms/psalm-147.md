# Psalm 147

<sup>1</sup> Give praise to the Lord; for it is good to make melody to our God; praise is pleasing and beautiful. 

<sup>2</sup> The Lord is building up Jerusalem; he makes all the outlaws of Israel come together. 

<sup>3</sup> He makes the broken-hearted well, and puts oil on their wounds. 

<sup>4</sup> He sees the number of the stars; he gives them all their names. 

<sup>5</sup> Great is our Lord, and great his power; there is no limit to his wisdom. 

<sup>6</sup> The Lord gives help to the poor in spirit; but he sends sinners down in shame. 

<sup>7</sup> Make songs of praise to the Lord; make melody to our God with instruments of music. 

<sup>8</sup> By his hand the heaven is covered with clouds and rain is stored up for the earth; he makes the grass tall on the mountains. 

<sup>9</sup> He gives food to every beast, and to the young ravens in answer to their cry. 

<sup>10</sup> He has no delight in the strength of a horse; he takes no pleasure in the legs of a man. 

<sup>11</sup> The Lord takes pleasure in his worshippers, and in those whose hope is in his mercy. 

<sup>12</sup> Give praise to the Lord, O Jerusalem; give praise to your God, O Zion. 

<sup>13</sup> He has made strong the iron bands of your doors; he has sent blessings on your children inside your walls. 

<sup>14</sup> He gives peace in all your land, making your stores full of fat grain. 

<sup>15</sup> He sends out his orders to the earth; his word goes out quickly. 

<sup>16</sup> He gives snow like wool; he sends out ice-drops like dust. 

<sup>17</sup> He sends down ice like raindrops: water is made hard by his cold. 

<sup>18</sup> At the outgoing of his word, the ice is turned to water; when he sends out his wind, there is a flowing of waters. 

<sup>19</sup> He makes his word clear to Jacob, teaching Israel his laws and his decisions. 

<sup>20</sup> He has not done these things for any other nation: and as for his laws, they have no knowledge of them. Let the Lord be praised.
