# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles,

<sup>2</sup> If that ordering of the grace of God has come to your knowledge, which was given to me for you,

<sup>3</sup> How by revelation the secret was made clear to me, as I said before in a short letter,

<sup>4</sup> By the reading of which you will be clear about my knowledge of the secret of Christ;

<sup>5</sup> Which in other generations was not given to the sons of men, but the revelation of it has now been made to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit;

<sup>6</sup> Which is that the Gentiles have a part in the heritage, and in the same body, and in the same hope in Christ through the good news,

<sup>7</sup> Of which I was made a preacher, through that grace of God which was given to me in the measure of the working of his power.

<sup>8</sup> To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, was this grace given, so that I might make clear to the Gentiles the good news of the unending wealth of Christ:

<sup>9</sup> And make all men see what is the ordering of the secret which from the first has been kept in God who made all things;

<sup>10</sup> So that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavens might be made clear through the church the wide-shining wisdom of God,

<sup>11</sup> Which is seen in his eternal purpose in Christ Jesus our Lord:

<sup>12</sup> By whom we come near to God without fear through faith in him.

<sup>13</sup> For this reason it is my prayer that you may not become feeble because of my troubles for you, which are your glory.

<sup>14</sup> For this cause I go down on my knees before the Father,

<sup>15</sup> From whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,

<sup>16</sup> That in the wealth of his glory he would make you strong with power through his Spirit in your hearts;

<sup>17</sup> So that Christ may have his place in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and based in love,

<sup>18</sup> May have strength to see with all the saints how wide and long and high and deep it is,

<sup>19</sup> And to have knowledge of the love of Christ which is outside all knowledge, so that you may be made complete as God himself is complete.

<sup>20</sup> Now to him who is able to do in full measure more than all our desires or thoughts, through the power which is working in us,

<sup>21</sup> To him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations for ever and ever. So be it.
