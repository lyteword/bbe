# Psalm 123 

A Song of the going up.

**¹** To you my eyes are lifted up, even to you whose seat is in the heavens.

**²** See! as the eyes of servants are turned to the hands of their masters, and the eyes of a servant-girl to her owner, so our eyes are waiting for the Lord our God, till he has mercy on us.

**³** Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us: for all men are looking down on us.

**⁴** For long enough have men of pride made sport of our soul.
