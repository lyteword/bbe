# Psalm 95

<sup>1</sup> O come, let us make songs to the Lord; sending up glad voices to the Rock of our salvation. 

<sup>2</sup> Let us come before his face with praises; and make melody with holy songs. 

<sup>3</sup> For the Lord is a great God, and a great King over all gods. 

<sup>4</sup> The deep places of the earth are in his hand; and the tops of the mountains are his. 

<sup>5</sup> The sea is his, and he made it; and the dry land was formed by his hands. 

<sup>6</sup> O come, let us give worship, falling down on our knees before the Lord our Maker. 

<sup>7</sup> For he is our God; and we are the people to whom he gives food, and the sheep of his flock. Today, if you would only give ear to his voice! 

<sup>8</sup> Let not your hearts be hard, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the waste land; 

<sup>9</sup> When your fathers put me to the test and saw my power and my work. 

<sup>10</sup> For forty years I was angry with this generation, and said, They are a people whose hearts are turned away from me, for they have no knowledge of my ways; 

<sup>11</sup> And I made an oath in my wrath, that they might not come into my place of rest.
