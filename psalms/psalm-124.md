# Psalm 124

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. Of David. If it had not been the Lord who was on our side (let Israel now say); 

<sup>2</sup> If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men came up against us; 

<sup>3</sup> They would have made a meal of us while still living, in the heat of their wrath against us: 

<sup>4</sup> We would have been covered by the waters; the streams would have gone over our soul; 

<sup>5</sup> Yes, the waters of pride would have gone over our soul. 

<sup>6</sup> Praise be to the Lord, who has not let us be wounded by their teeth. 

<sup>7</sup> Our soul has gone free like a bird out of the net of those who would take her: the net is broken, and we are free. 

<sup>8</sup> Our help is in the name of the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
