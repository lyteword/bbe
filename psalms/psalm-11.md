# Psalm 11

For the chief music-maker. Of David.

**¹** In the Lord put I my faith; how will you say to my soul, Go in flight like a bird to the mountain?

**²** See, the bows of the evil-doers are bent, they make ready their arrows on the cord, so that they may send them secretly against the upright in heart.

**³** If the bases are broken down, what is the upright man to do?

**⁴** The Lord is in his holy Temple, the Lord's seat is in heaven; his eyes are watching and testing the children of men.

**⁵** The Lord puts the upright and the sinner to the test, but he has hate in his soul for the lover of violent acts.

**⁶** On the evil-doer he will send down fire and flames, and a burning wind; with these will their cup be full.

**⁷** For the Lord is upright; he is a lover of righteousness: the upright will see his face.
