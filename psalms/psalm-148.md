# Psalm 148

**¹** Give praise to the Lord. Let the Lord be praised from the heavens: give him praise in the skies.

**²** Give praise to him, all you his angels: give praise to him, all his armies.

**³** Give praise to him, you sun and moon: give praise to him, all you stars of light.

**⁴** Give praise to him, you highest heavens, and you waters which are over the heavens.

**⁵** Let them give praise to the name of the Lord: for he gave the order, and they were made.

**⁶** He has put them in their places for ever; he has given them their limits which may not be broken.

**⁷** Give praise to the Lord from the earth, you great sea-beasts, and deep places:

**⁸** Fire and rain of ice, snow and mists; storm-wind, doing his word:

**⁹** Mountains and all hills; fruit-trees and all trees of the mountains:

**¹⁰** Beasts and all cattle; insects and winged birds:

**¹¹** Kings of the earth, and all peoples; rulers and all judges of the earth:

**¹²** Young men and virgins; old men and children:

**¹³** Let them give glory to the name of the Lord: for his name only is to be praised: his kingdom is over the earth and the heaven.

**¹⁴** He has put on high the horn of his people, for the praise of all his saints; even the children of Israel, a people which is near to him. Let the Lord be praised.
