# Psalm 92

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath. It is a good thing to give praise to the Lord, and to make melody to your name, O Most High; 

<sup>2</sup> To make clear your mercy in the morning, and your unchanging faith every night; 

<sup>3</sup> On a ten-corded instrument, and on an instrument of music with a quiet sound. 

<sup>4</sup> For you, O Lord, have made me glad through your work; I will have joy in the works of your hands. 

<sup>5</sup> O Lord, how great are your works! and your thoughts are very deep. 

<sup>6</sup> A man without sense has no knowledge of this; and a foolish man may not take it in. 

<sup>7</sup> When the sinners come up like the grass, and all the workers of evil do well for themselves, it is so that their end may be eternal destruction. 

<sup>8</sup> But you, O Lord, are on high for ever. 

<sup>9</sup> For see! your haters, O Lord, will be put to death; all the workers of evil will be put to flight; 

<sup>10</sup> But my horn is lifted up like the horn of the ox: the best oil is flowing on my head. 

<sup>11</sup> My eyes have seen trouble come on my haters; my ears have news of the fate of the evil-doers who have come up against me. 

<sup>12</sup> The good man will be like a tall tree in his strength; his growth will be as the wide-stretching trees of Lebanon. 

<sup>13</sup> Those who are planted in the house of the Lord will come up tall and strong in his gardens. 

<sup>14</sup> They will give fruit even when they are old; they will be fertile and full of growth; 

<sup>15</sup> For a sign that the Lord is upright; he is my Rock, there is no deceit in him.
