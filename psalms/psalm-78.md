# Psalm 78

<sup>1</sup> Maschil. Of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law; let your ears be bent down to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>2</sup> Opening my mouth I will give out a story, even the dark sayings of old times; 

<sup>3</sup> Which have come to our hearing and our knowledge, as they were given to us by our fathers. 

<sup>4</sup> We will not keep them secret from our children; we will make clear to the coming generation the praises of the Lord and his strength, and the great works of wonder which he has done. 

<sup>5</sup> He put up a witness in Jacob, and made a law in Israel; which he gave to our fathers so that they might give knowledge of them to their children; 

<sup>6</sup> So that the generation to come might have knowledge of them, even the children of the future, who would give word of them to their children; 

<sup>7</sup> So that they might put their hope in God, and not let God's works go out of their minds, but keep his laws; 

<sup>8</sup> And not be like their fathers, a stiff-necked and uncontrolled generation; a generation whose heart was hard, whose spirit was not true to God. 

<sup>9</sup> The children of Ephraim, armed with bows, were turned back on the day of the fight. 

<sup>10</sup> They were not ruled by God's word, and they would not go in the way of his law; 

<sup>11</sup> They let his works go out of their memory, and the wonders which he had made them see. 

<sup>12</sup> He did great works before the eyes of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan. 

<sup>13</sup> The sea was cut in two so that they might go through; the waters were massed together on this side and on that. 

<sup>14</sup> In the daytime he was guiding them in the cloud, and all through the night with a light of fire. 

<sup>15</sup> The rocks of the waste land were broken by his power, and he gave them drink as out of the deep waters. 

<sup>16</sup> He made streams come out of the rock; and waters came flowing down like rivers. 

<sup>17</sup> And they went on sinning against him even more, turning away from the Most High in the waste land; 

<sup>18</sup> Testing God in their hearts, requesting meat for their desire. 

<sup>19</sup> They said bitter words against God, saying, Is God able to make ready a table in the waste land? 

<sup>20</sup> See, the rock was cut open by his power, so that the water came rushing out, and overflowing streams; is he able to give us bread? is he able to get meat for his people? 

<sup>21</sup> So these things came to the Lord's ears, and he was angry; and a fire was lighted against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel; 

<sup>22</sup> Because they had no faith in God, and no hope in his salvation. 

<sup>23</sup> And he gave orders to the clouds on high, and the doors of heaven were open; 

<sup>24</sup> And he sent down manna like rain for their food, and gave them the grain of heaven. 

<sup>25</sup> Man took part in the food of strong ones; he sent them meat in full measure. 

<sup>26</sup> He sent an east wind from heaven, driving on the south wind by his power. 

<sup>27</sup> He sent down meat on them like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the sea, 

<sup>28</sup> And he let it come down into their resting-place, round about their tents. 

<sup>29</sup> So they had food and were full; for he gave them their desire; 

<sup>30</sup> But they were not turned from their desires; and while the food was still in their mouths, 

<sup>31</sup> The wrath of God came on them, and put to death the fattest of them, and put an end to the young men of Israel. 

<sup>32</sup> For all this they went on sinning even more, and had no faith in his great wonders. 

<sup>33</sup> So their days were wasted like a breath, and their years in trouble. 

<sup>34</sup> When he sent death on them, then they made search for him; turning to him and looking for him with care; 

<sup>35</sup> In the memory that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their saviour. 

<sup>36</sup> But their lips were false to him, and their tongues were untrue to him; 

<sup>37</sup> And their hearts were not right with him, and they did not keep their agreement with him. 

<sup>38</sup> But he, being full of pity, has forgiveness for sin, and does not put an end to man: frequently turning back his wrath, and not being violently angry. 

<sup>39</sup> So he kept in mind that they were only flesh; a breath which is quickly gone, and will not come again. 

<sup>40</sup> How frequently did they go against him in the waste land, and give him cause for grief in the dry places! 

<sup>41</sup> Again they put God to the test, and gave pain to the Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>42</sup> They did not keep in mind the work of his hand, or the day when he took them from the power of their haters; 

<sup>43</sup> How he had done his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan; 

<sup>44</sup> So that their rivers were turned to blood, and they were not able to get drink from their streams. 

<sup>45</sup> He sent different sorts of flies among them, poisoning their flesh; and frogs for their destruction. 

<sup>46</sup> He gave the increase of their fields to worms, the fruits of their industry to the locusts. 

<sup>47</sup> He sent ice for the destruction of their vines; their trees were damaged by the bitter cold. 

<sup>48</sup> Ice was rained down on their cattle; thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks. 

<sup>49</sup> He sent on them the heat of his wrath, his bitter disgust, letting loose evil angels among them. 

<sup>50</sup> He let his wrath have its way; he did not keep back their soul from death, but gave their life to disease. 

<sup>51</sup> He gave to destruction all the first sons of Egypt; the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham; 

<sup>52</sup> But he took his people out like sheep, guiding them in the waste land like a flock. 

<sup>53</sup> He took them on safely so that they had no fear; but their haters were covered by the sea. 

<sup>54</sup> And he was their guide to his holy land, even to the mountain, which his right hand had made his; 

<sup>55</sup> Driving out nations before them, marking out the line of their heritage, and giving the people of Israel their tents for a resting-place. 

<sup>56</sup> But they were bitter against the Most High God, testing him, and not keeping his laws; 

<sup>57</sup> Their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers; they were turned to one side like a twisted bow. 

<sup>58</sup> They made him angry with their high places; moving him to wrath with their images. 

<sup>59</sup> When this came to God's ears he was very angry, and gave up Israel completely; 

<sup>60</sup> So that he went away from the holy place in Shiloh, the tent which he had put among men; 

<sup>61</sup> And he let his strength be taken prisoner, and gave his glory into the hands of his hater. 

<sup>62</sup> He gave his people up to the sword, and was angry with his heritage. 

<sup>63</sup> Their young men were burned in the fire; and their virgins were not praised in the bride-song. 

<sup>64</sup> Their priests were put to death by the sword, and their widows made no weeping for them. 

<sup>65</sup> Then was the Lord like one awaking from sleep, and like a strong man crying out because of wine. 

<sup>66</sup> His haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever. 

<sup>67</sup> And he put the tent of Joseph on one side, and took not the tribe of Ephraim; 

<sup>68</sup> But he took the tribe of Judah for himself, and the mountain of Zion, in which he had pleasure. 

<sup>69</sup> And he made his holy place like the high heaven, like the earth which is fixed by him for ever. 

<sup>70</sup> He took David to be his servant, taking him from the place of the flocks; 

<sup>71</sup> From looking after the sheep which were giving milk, he took him to give food to Jacob his people, and to Israel his heritage. 

<sup>72</sup> So he gave them food with an upright heart, guiding them by the wisdom of his hands.
