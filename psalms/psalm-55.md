# Psalm 55 

To the chief music-maker, on Neginoth. Maschil. Of David.

**¹** Give hearing to my prayer, O God; and let not your ear be shut against my request.

**²** Give thought to me, and let my prayer be answered: I have been made low in sorrow;

**³** I am troubled because of the voice of the cruel ones, because of the loud cry of the evil-doers; for they put a weight of evil on me, and they are cruel in their hate for me.

**⁴** My heart is deeply wounded, and the fear of death has come on me.

**⁵** Fear and shaking have come over me, with deep fear I am covered.

**⁶** And I said, If only I had wings like a dove! for then I would go in flight from here and be at rest.

**⁷** I would go wandering far away, living in the waste land. (Selah.)

**⁸** I would quickly take cover from the driving storm and from the violent wind.

**⁹** Send destruction on them, O Lord, make a division of tongues among them: for I have seen fighting and violent acts in the town.

**¹⁰** By day and night they go round the town, on the walls; trouble and sorrow are in the heart of it.

**¹¹** Evil is there; cruel rule and deceit are ever in the streets.

**¹²** For it was not my hater who said evil of me; that would have been no grief to me; it was not one outside the number of my friends who made himself strong against me, or I would have kept myself from him in a secret place;

**¹³** But it was you, my equal, my guide, my well-loved friend.

**¹⁴** We had loving talk together, and went to the house of God in company.

**¹⁵** Let the hand of death come on them suddenly, and let them go down living into the underworld; because evil is in their houses and in their hearts.

**¹⁶** As for me, I will make my prayer to God, and he will be my saviour.

**¹⁷** In the evening and in the morning and in the middle of the day I will make my prayer with sounds of grief; and my voice will come to his ears.

**¹⁸** He has taken my soul away from the attack which was made against me, and given it peace; for great numbers were against me.

**¹⁹** God will give thought to me; he who from early times is strong will send pain and trouble on them. (Selah.) Because they are unchanged, they have no fear of God.

**²⁰** He has put out his hand against those who were at peace with him; he has not kept his agreement.

**²¹** The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, but they were sharp swords.

**²²** Put your cares on the Lord, and he will be your support; he will not let the upright man be moved.

**²³** But you, O God, will send them down into the underworld; the cruel and the false will be cut off before half their days are ended; but I will have faith in you.
