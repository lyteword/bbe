# Chapter 2

**¹** My desire is, first of all, that you will make requests and prayers and give praise for all men;

**²** For kings and all those in authority; so that we may have a calm and quiet life in all fear of God and serious behaviour.

**³** This is good and pleasing in the eyes of God our Saviour;

**⁴** Whose desire is that all men may have salvation and come to the knowledge of what is true.

**⁵** For there is one God and one peacemaker between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

**⁶** Who gave himself as an offering for all; witness of which was to be given at the right time;

**⁷** And of this I became a preacher and an Apostle (what I say is true, not false,) and a teacher of the Gentiles in the true faith.

**⁸** It is my desire, then, that in every place men may give themselves to prayer, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or argument.

**⁹** And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price;

**¹⁰** But clothed with good works, as is right for women who are living in the fear of God.

**¹¹** Let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority.

**¹²** In my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher, or to have rule over a man, but to be quiet.

**¹³** For Adam was first formed, then Eve;

**¹⁴** And Adam was not taken by deceit, but the woman, being tricked, became a wrongdoer.

**¹⁵** But if they go on in faith and love and holy self-control, she will be kept safe at the time of childbirth.
