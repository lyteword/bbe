# Psalm 134

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. Give praise to the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who take your places in the house of the Lord by night. 

<sup>2</sup> Give praise to the Lord, lifting up your hands in his holy place. 

<sup>3</sup> May the Lord, who made heaven and earth, send you blessing out of Zion,
