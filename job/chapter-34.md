# Chapter 34

<sup>1</sup> And Elihu made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Give ear, you wise, to my words; and you who have knowledge, give attention to me; 

<sup>3</sup> For words are tested by the ear, as food is tasted by the mouth. 

<sup>4</sup> Let us make the decision for ourselves as to what is right; let us have the knowledge among ourselves of what is good. 

<sup>5</sup> For Job has said, I am upright, and it is God who has taken away my right; 

<sup>6</sup> Though I am right, still I am in pain; my wound may not be made well, though I have done no wrong. 

<sup>7</sup> What man is like Job, a man who freely makes sport of God, 

<sup>8</sup> And goes in the company of evil-doers, walking in the way of sinners? 

<sup>9</sup> For he has said, It is no profit to a man to take delight in God. 

<sup>10</sup> Now then, you wise, take note; you men of knowledge, give ear to me. Let it be far from God to do evil, and from the Ruler of all to do wrong. 

<sup>11</sup> For he gives to every man the reward of his work, and sees that he gets the fruit of his ways. 

<sup>12</sup> Truly, God does not do evil, and the Ruler of all is not a false judge. 

<sup>13</sup> Who put the earth into his care, or made him responsible for the world? 

<sup>14</sup> If he made his spirit come back to him, taking his breath into himself again, 

<sup>15</sup> All flesh would come to an end together, and man would go back to the dust. 

<sup>16</sup> If you are wise, take note of this; give ear to the voice of my words. 

<sup>17</sup> How may a hater of right be a ruler? and will you say that the upright Ruler of all is evil? 

<sup>18</sup> He who says to a king, You are an evil-doer; and to rulers, You are sinners; 

<sup>19</sup> Who has no respect for rulers, and who gives no more attention to those who have wealth than to the poor, for they are all the work of his hands. 

<sup>20</sup> Suddenly they come to an end, even in the middle of the night: the blow comes on the men of wealth, and they are gone, and the strong are taken away without the hand of man. 

<sup>21</sup> For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps. 

<sup>22</sup> There is no dark place, and no thick cloud, in which the workers of evil may take cover. 

<sup>23</sup> For he does not give man a fixed time to come before him to be judged. 

<sup>24</sup> He sends the strong to destruction without searching out their cause, and puts others in their place. 

<sup>25</sup> For he has knowledge of their works, overturning them in the night, so that they are crushed. 

<sup>26</sup> The evil-doers are broken by his wrath, he puts his hand on them with force before the eyes of all onlookers. 

<sup>27</sup> Because they did not go after him, and took no note of his ways, 

<sup>28</sup> So that the cry of the poor might come up to him, and the prayer of those in need come to his ears. 

<sup>29</sup> ... 

<sup>30</sup> ... 

<sup>31</sup> ... 

<sup>32</sup> ... 

<sup>33</sup> ... 

<sup>34</sup> Men of knowledge, and all wise men, hearing me, will say, 

<sup>35</sup> Job's words do not come from knowledge; they are not the fruit of wisdom. 

<sup>36</sup> May Job be tested to the end, because his answers have been like those of evil men. 

<sup>37</sup> For in addition to his sin, he is uncontrolled in heart; before our eyes he makes sport of God, increasing his words against him.
