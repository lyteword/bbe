# Psalm 133 

A Song of the going up. Of David.

**¹** See how good and how pleasing it is for brothers to be living together in harmony!

**²** It is like oil of great price on the head, flowing down over the face, even Aaron's face: coming down to the edge of his robe;

**³** Like the dew of Hermon, which comes down on the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord gave orders for the blessing, even life for ever.
