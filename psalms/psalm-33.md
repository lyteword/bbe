# Psalm 33 

**¹** Be glad in the Lord, O doers of righteousness; for praise is beautiful for the upright.

**²** Give praise to the Lord on the corded instrument; make melody to him with instruments of music.

**³** Make a new song to him; playing expertly with a loud noise.

**⁴** For the word of the Lord is upright, and all his works are certain.

**⁵** His delight is in righteousness and wisdom; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.

**⁶** By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the army of heaven by the breath of his mouth.

**⁷** He makes the waters of the sea come together in a mass; he keeps the deep seas in store-houses.

**⁸** Let the earth be full of the fear of the Lord; let all the people of the world be in holy fear of him.

**⁹** For he gave the word, and it was done; by his order it was fixed for ever.

**¹⁰** The Lord undoes the designs of the nations; he makes the thoughts of the peoples without effect.

**¹¹** The Lord's purpose is eternal, the designs of his heart go on through all the generations of man.

**¹²** Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he has taken for his heritage.

**¹³** The Lord is looking down from heaven; he sees all the sons of men;

**¹⁴** From his house he keeps watch on all who are living on the earth;

**¹⁵** He makes all their hearts; their works are clear to him.

**¹⁶** A king's salvation is not in the power of his army; a strong man does not get free by his great strength.

**¹⁷** A horse is a false hope; his great power will not make any man free from danger.

**¹⁸** See, the eye of the Lord is on those in whose hearts is the fear of him, on those whose hope is in his mercy;

**¹⁹** To keep their souls from death; and to keep them living in time of need.

**²⁰** Our souls are waiting for the Lord; he is our help and our salvation.

**²¹** For in him our hearts have joy; in his holy name is our hope.

**²²** Let your mercy be on us, O Lord, as we are waiting for you.
