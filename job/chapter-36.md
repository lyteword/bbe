# Chapter 36

<sup>1</sup> And Elihu went on to say, 

<sup>2</sup> Give me a little more time, and I will make it clear to you; for I have still something to say for God. 

<sup>3</sup> I will get my knowledge from far, and I will give righteousness to my Maker. 

<sup>4</sup> For truly my words are not false; one who has all knowledge is talking with you. 

<sup>5</sup> Truly, God gives up the hard-hearted, and will not give life to the sinner. 

<sup>6</sup> His eyes are ever on the upright, and he gives to the crushed their right; 

<sup>7</sup> Lifting them up to the seat of kings, and making them safe for ever. 

<sup>8</sup> And if they have been prisoned in chains, and taken in cords of trouble, 

<sup>9</sup> Then he makes clear to them what they have done, even their evil works in which they have taken pride. 

<sup>10</sup> Their ear is open to his teaching, and he gives them orders so that their hearts may be turned from evil. 

<sup>11</sup> If they give ear to his voice, and do his word, then he gives them long life, and years full of pleasure. 

<sup>12</sup> But if not, they come to their end, and give up their breath without knowledge. 

<sup>13</sup> Those who have no fear of God keep wrath stored up in their hearts; they give no cry for help when they are made prisoners. 

<sup>14</sup> They come to their end while they are still young, their life is short like that of those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of their gods. 

<sup>15</sup> He makes the wrong done to the poor the way of their salvation, opening their ears by their trouble. 

<sup>16</sup> ... 

<sup>17</sup> ... 

<sup>18</sup> ... 

<sup>19</sup> ... 

<sup>20</sup> ... 

<sup>21</sup> Take care not to be turned to sin, for you have taken evil for your part in place of sorrow. 

<sup>22</sup> Truly God is lifted up in strength; who is a ruler like him? 

<sup>23</sup> Who ever gave orders to him, or said to him, You have done wrong? 

<sup>24</sup> See that you give praise to his work, about which men make songs. 

<sup>25</sup> All people are looking on it; man sees it from far. 

<sup>26</sup> Truly, God is great, greater than all our knowledge; the number of his years may not be searched out. 

<sup>27</sup> For he takes up the drops from the sea; he sends them through his mist as rain, 

<sup>28</sup> Flowing down from the sky, and dropping on the peoples. 

<sup>29</sup> And who has knowledge of how the clouds are stretched out, or of the thunders of his tent? 

<sup>30</sup> See, he is stretching out his mist, covering the tops of the mountains with it. 

<sup>31</sup> For by these he gives food to the peoples, and bread in full measure. 

<sup>32</sup> He takes the light in his hands, sending it against the mark. 

<sup>33</sup> The thunder makes clear his passion, and the storm gives news of his wrath.
