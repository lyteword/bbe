# Psalm 144 

A Psalm. Of David.

**¹** Praise be to the God of my strength, teaching my hands the use of the sword, and my fingers the art of fighting:

**²** He is my strength, and my Rock; my high tower, and my saviour; my keeper and my hope: he gives me authority over my people.

**³** Lord, what is man, that you keep him in mind? or the son of man that you take him into account?

**⁴** Man is like a breath: his life is like a shade which is quickly gone.

**⁵** Come down, O Lord, from your heavens: at your touch let the mountains give out smoke.

**⁶** With your storm-flames send them in flight: send out your arrows for their destruction.

**⁷** Put out your hand from on high; make me free, take me safely out of the great waters, and out of the hands of strange men;

**⁸** In whose mouths are false words, and whose right hand is a right hand of deceit.

**⁹** I will make a new song to you, O God; I will make melody to you on an instrument of ten cords.

**¹⁰** It is God who gives salvation to kings; and who kept his servant David from the wounding sword.

**¹¹** Make me free, and take me out of the hands of strange men, in whose mouths are false words, and whose right hand is a right hand of deceit.

**¹²** Our sons are like tall young plants; and our daughters like the shining stones of a king's house;

**¹³** Our store-houses are full of all good things; and our sheep give birth to thousands and ten thousands in our fields.

**¹⁴** Our oxen are well weighted down; our cows give birth safely; there is no going out, and there is no cry of sorrow in our open places.

**¹⁵** Happy is the nation whose ways are so ordered: yes, happy is the nation whose God is the Lord.
