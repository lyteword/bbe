# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> And Abraham took another wife named Keturah.

<sup>2</sup> She became the mother of Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.

<sup>3</sup> And Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. And from Dedan came the Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim.

<sup>4</sup> And from Midian came Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the offspring of Keturah.

<sup>5</sup> Now Abraham gave all his property to Isaac;

<sup>6</sup> But to the sons of his other women he gave offerings, and sent them away, while he was still living, into the east country.

<sup>7</sup> Now the years of Abraham's life were a hundred and seventy-five.

<sup>8</sup> And Abraham came to his death, an old man, full of years; and he was put to rest with his people.

<sup>9</sup> And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, put him to rest in the hollow rock of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, near Mamre;

<sup>10</sup> The same field which Abraham got from the children of Heth: there Abraham was put to rest with Sarah, his wife.

<sup>11</sup> Now after the death of Abraham, the blessing of God was with Isaac, his son.

<sup>12</sup> Now these are the generations of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, whose mother was Hagar the Egyptian, the servant of Sarah:

<sup>13</sup> These are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their generations: Ishmael's first son was Nebaioth; then Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam

<sup>14</sup> And Mishma and Dumah and Massa,

<sup>15</sup> Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

<sup>16</sup> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names in their towns and their tent-circles; twelve chiefs with their peoples.

<sup>17</sup> And the years of Ishmael's life were a hundred and thirty-seven: and he came to his end, and was put to rest with his people.

<sup>18</sup> And their country was from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt: they took their place to the east of all their brothers.

<sup>19</sup> Now these are the generations of Abraham's son Isaac:

<sup>20</sup> Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean of Paddan-aram, and the sister of Laban the Aramaean, to be his wife.

<sup>21</sup> Isaac made prayer to the Lord for his wife because she had no children; and the Lord gave ear to his prayer, and Rebekah became with child.

<sup>22</sup> And the children were fighting together inside her, and she said, If it is to be so, why am I like this? So she went to put her question to the Lord.

<sup>23</sup> And the Lord said to her, Two nations are in your body, and two peoples will come to birth from you: the one will be stronger than the other, and the older will be the servant of the younger.

<sup>24</sup> And when the time came for her to give birth, there were two children in her body.

<sup>25</sup> And the first came out red from head to foot like a robe of hair, and they gave him the name of Esau.

<sup>26</sup> And after him, his brother came out, gripping Esau's foot; and he was named Jacob: Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them.

<sup>27</sup> And the boys came to full growth; and Esau became a man of the open country, an expert bowman; but Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.

<sup>28</sup> Now Isaac's love was for Esau, because Esau's meat was greatly to his taste: but Rebekah had more love for Jacob.

<sup>29</sup> And one day Jacob was cooking some soup when Esau came in from the fields in great need of food;

<sup>30</sup> And Esau said to Jacob, Give me a full meal of that red soup, for I am overcome with need for food: for this reason he was named Edom.

<sup>31</sup> And Jacob said, First of all give me your birthright.

<sup>32</sup> And Esau said, Truly, I am at the point of death: what profit is the birthright to me?

<sup>33</sup> And Jacob said, First of all give me your oath; and he gave him his oath, handing over his birthright to Jacob.

<sup>34</sup> Then Jacob gave him bread and soup; and he took food and drink and went away, caring little for his birthright.
