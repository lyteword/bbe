# Psalm 75

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker; put to Al-tashheth. A Psalm. Of Asaph. A Song. To you, O God, we give praise, to you we give praise: and those who give honour to your name make clear your works of power. 

<sup>2</sup> When the right time has come, I will be the judge in righteousness. 

<sup>3</sup> When the earth and all its people become feeble, I am the support of its pillars. (Selah.) 

<sup>4</sup> I say to the men of pride, Let your pride be gone: and to the sinners, Let not your horn be lifted up. 

<sup>5</sup> Let not your horn be lifted up: let no more words of pride come from your outstretched necks. 

<sup>6</sup> For honour does not come from the east, or from the west, or uplifting from the south; 

<sup>7</sup> But God is the judge, putting down one, and lifting up another. 

<sup>8</sup> For in the hand of the Lord is a cup, and the wine is red; it is well mixed, overflowing from his hand: he will make all the sinners of the earth take of it, even to the last drop. 

<sup>9</sup> But I will ever be full of joy, making songs of praise to the God of Jacob. 

<sup>10</sup> By him will all the horns of the sinners be cut off; but the horns of the upright will be lifted up.
