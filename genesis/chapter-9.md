# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> And God gave his blessing to Noah and his sons, and said, Be fertile, and have increase, and make the earth full. 

<sup>2</sup> And the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air; everything which goes on the land, and all the fishes of the sea, are given into your hands. 

<sup>3</sup> Every living and moving thing will be food for you; I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things. 

<sup>4</sup> But flesh with the life-blood in it you may not take for food. 

<sup>5</sup> And for your blood, which is your life, will I take payment; from every beast I will take it, and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brother-man. 

<sup>6</sup> Whoever takes a man's life, by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image. 

<sup>7</sup> And now, be fertile and have increase; have offspring on the earth and become great in number. 

<sup>8</sup> And God said to Noah and to his sons, 

<sup>9</sup> Truly, I will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you, 

<sup>10</sup> And with every living thing with you, all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you. 

<sup>11</sup> And I will make my agreement with you; never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters; never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction. 

<sup>12</sup> And God said, This is the sign of the agreement which I make between me and you and every living thing with you, for all future generations: 

<sup>13</sup> I will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth. 

<sup>14</sup> And whenever I make a cloud come over the earth, the bow will be seen in the cloud, 

<sup>15</sup> And I will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing; and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh. 

<sup>16</sup> And the bow will be in the cloud, and looking on it, I will keep in mind the eternal agreement between God and every living thing on the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the agreement which I have made between me and all flesh on the earth. 

<sup>18</sup> And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan. 

<sup>19</sup> These three were the sons of Noah and from them all the earth was peopled. 

<sup>20</sup> In those days Noah became a farmer, and he made a vine-garden. 

<sup>21</sup> And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink; and he was uncovered in his tent. 

<sup>22</sup> And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father unclothed, and gave news of it to his two brothers outside. 

<sup>23</sup> And Shem and Japheth took a robe, and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away, and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed. 

<sup>24</sup> And, awaking from his wine, Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him, and he said, 

<sup>25</sup> Cursed be Canaan; let him be a servant of servants to his brothers. 

<sup>26</sup> And he said, Praise to the Lord, the God of Shem; let Canaan be his servant. 

<sup>27</sup> May God make Japheth great, and let his living-place be in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant. 

<sup>28</sup> And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters; 

<sup>29</sup> all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty: and he came to his end.
