# Psalm 44

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. Of the sons of Korah Maschil. It has come to our ears, O God, our fathers have given us the story, of the works which you did in their days, in the old times, 

<sup>2</sup> Uprooting the nations with your hand, and planting our fathers in their place; cutting down the nations, but increasing the growth of your people. 

<sup>3</sup> For they did not make the land theirs by their swords, and it was not their arms which kept them safe; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, because you had pleasure in them. 

<sup>4</sup> You are my King and my God; ordering salvation for Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> Through you will we overcome our haters; by your name will they be crushed under our feet who are violent against us. 

<sup>6</sup> I will not put faith in my bow, my sword will not be my salvation. 

<sup>7</sup> But it is you who have been our saviour from those who were against us, and have put to shame those who had hate for us. 

<sup>8</sup> Our pride is in God at all times, to his name we give praise for ever. (Selah.) 

<sup>9</sup> But now you have sent us away from you, and put us to shame; you do not go out with our armies. 

<sup>10</sup> Because of this we are turned back by the attacker: those who have hate for us take our goods for themselves. 

<sup>11</sup> You have made us like sheep which are taken for meat; we are put to flight among the nations. 

<sup>12</sup> You let your people go for nothing; your wealth is not increased by their price. 

<sup>13</sup> You have made us to be looked down on by our neighbours, we are laughed at and shamed by those who are round about us. 

<sup>14</sup> Our name is a word of shame among the nations, a sign for the shaking of heads among the peoples. 

<sup>15</sup> My downfall is ever before me, and I am covered with the shame of my face; 

<sup>16</sup> Because of the voice of him who says sharp and bitter words; because of the hater and him who is the instrument of punishment. 

<sup>17</sup> All this has come on us, but still we have kept you in our memory; and we have not been false to your word. 

<sup>18</sup> Our hearts have not gone back, and our steps have not been turned out of your way; 

<sup>19</sup> Though you have let us be crushed in the place of jackals, though we are covered with darkest shade. 

<sup>20</sup> If the name of our God has gone out of our minds, or if our hands have been stretched out to a strange god, 

<sup>21</sup> Will not God make search for it? for he sees the secrets of the heart. 

<sup>22</sup> Truly, because of you we are put to death every day; we are numbered like sheep for destruction. 

<sup>23</sup> Why are you sleeping, O Lord? awake! and come to our help, do not give us up for ever. 

<sup>24</sup> Why is your face covered, and why do you give no thought to our trouble and our cruel fate? 

<sup>25</sup> For our souls are crushed down to the dust: our bodies are stretched out on the earth. 

<sup>26</sup> Up! and come to our help, and give us salvation because of your mercy.
