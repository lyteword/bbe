# Psalm 63

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Of David. When he was in the waste land of Judah. O God, you are my God; early will I make my search for you: my soul is dry for need of you, my flesh is wasted with desire for you, as a dry and burning land where no water is; 

<sup>2</sup> To see your power and your glory, as I have seen you in the holy place. 

<sup>3</sup> Because your mercy is better than life, my lips will give you praise. 

<sup>4</sup> So will I go on blessing you all my life, lifting up my hands in your name. 

<sup>5</sup> My soul will be comforted, as with good food; and my mouth will give you praise with songs of joy; 

<sup>6</sup> When the memory of you comes to me on my bed, and when I give thought to you in the night-time. 

<sup>7</sup> Because you have been my help, I will have joy in the shade of your wings. 

<sup>8</sup> My soul keeps ever near you: your right hand is my support. 

<sup>9</sup> But those whose desire is my soul's destruction will go down to the lower parts of the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> They will be cut off by the sword; they will be food for foxes. 

<sup>11</sup> But the king will have joy in God; everyone who takes an oath by him will have cause for pride; but the false mouth will be stopped.
