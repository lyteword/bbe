# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point: We have such a high priest, who has taken his place at the right hand of God's high seat of glory in heaven, 

<sup>2</sup> As a servant of the holy things and of the true Tent, which was put up by God, not by man. 

<sup>3</sup> Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings; so that it is necessary for this man, like them, to have something for an offering. 

<sup>4</sup> If he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all, because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law; 

<sup>5</sup> Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven, as Moses, when he was about to make the Tent, had special orders from God: for, See, he said, that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain. 

<sup>6</sup> But now his position as priest is higher. because through him God has made a better agreement with man, based on the giving of better things. 

<sup>7</sup> For if that first agreement had been as good as possible, there would have been no place for a second. 

<sup>8</sup> For, protesting against them, he says, See, the days are coming when I will make a new agreement with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; 

<sup>9</sup> Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand, to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; for they did not keep the agreement with me, and I gave them up, says the Lord. 

<sup>10</sup> For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days: I will put my laws into their minds, writing them in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they will be my people: 

<sup>11</sup> And there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother, or his neighbour, saying, This is the knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, great and small. 

<sup>12</sup> And I will have mercy on their evil-doing, and I will not keep their sins in mind. 

<sup>13</sup> When he says, A new agreement, he has made the first agreement old. But anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer.
