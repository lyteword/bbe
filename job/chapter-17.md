# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> My spirit is broken, my days are ended, the last resting-place is ready for me. 

<sup>2</sup> Truly, those who make sport of me are round about me, and my eyes become dark because of their bitter laughing. 

<sup>3</sup> Be pleased, now, to be responsible for me to yourself; for there is no other who will put his hand in mine. 

<sup>4</sup> You have kept their hearts from wisdom: for this cause you will not give them honour. 

<sup>5</sup> As for him who is false to his friend for a reward, light will be cut off from the eyes of his children. 

<sup>6</sup> He has made me a word of shame to the peoples; I have become a mark for their sport. 

<sup>7</sup> My eyes have become dark because of my pain, and all my body is wasted to a shade. 

<sup>8</sup> The upright are surprised at this, and he who has done no wrong is troubled because of the evil-doers. 

<sup>9</sup> Still the upright keeps on his way, and he who has clean hands gets new strength. 

<sup>10</sup> But come back, now, all of you, come; and I will not see a wise man among you. 

<sup>11</sup> My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the desires of my heart. 

<sup>12</sup> They are changing night into day; they say, The light is near the dark. 

<sup>13</sup> If I am waiting for the underworld as my house, if I have made my bed in the dark; 

<sup>14</sup> If I say to the earth, You are my father; and to the worm, My mother and my sister; 

<sup>15</sup> Where then is my hope? and who will see my desire? 

<sup>16</sup> Will they go down with me into the underworld? Will we go down together into the dust?
