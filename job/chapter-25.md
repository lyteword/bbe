# Job 25 

**¹** Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,

**²** Rule and power are his; he makes peace in his high places.

**³** Is it possible for his armies to be numbered? and on whom is not his light shining?

**⁴** How then is it possible for man to be upright before God? or how may he be clean who is a son of woman?

**⁵** See, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not clean in his eyes:

**⁶** How much less man who is an insect, and the son of man who is a worm!
