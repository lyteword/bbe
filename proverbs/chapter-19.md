# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Better is the poor man whose ways are upright, than the man of wealth whose ways are twisted. 

<sup>2</sup> Further, without knowledge desire is not good; and he who is over-quick in acting goes out of the right way. 

<sup>3</sup> By his foolish behaviour a man's ways are turned upside down, and his heart is bitter against the Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> Wealth makes a great number of friends; but the poor man is parted from his friend. 

<sup>5</sup> A false witness will not go without punishment, and the breather out of deceit will not go free. 

<sup>6</sup> Great numbers will make attempts to get the approval of a ruler: and every man is the special friend of him who has something to give. 

<sup>7</sup> All the brothers of the poor man are against him: how much more do his friends go far from him! ... 

<sup>8</sup> He who gets wisdom has love for his soul: he who keeps good sense will get what is truly good. 

<sup>9</sup> A false witness will not go without punishment, and the breather out of deceit will be cut off. 

<sup>10</sup> Material comfort is not good for the foolish; much less for a servant to be put over rulers. 

<sup>11</sup> A man's good sense makes him slow to wrath, and the overlooking of wrongdoing is his glory. 

<sup>12</sup> The king's wrath is like the loud cry of a lion, but his approval is like dew on the grass. 

<sup>13</sup> A foolish son is the destruction of his father; and the bitter arguments of a wife are like drops of rain falling without end. 

<sup>14</sup> House and wealth are a heritage from fathers, but a wife with good sense is from the Lord. 

<sup>15</sup> Hate of work sends deep sleep on a man: and he who has no industry will go without food. 

<sup>16</sup> He who keeps the law keeps his soul; but death will be the fate of him who takes no note of the word. 

<sup>17</sup> He who has pity on the poor gives to the Lord, and the Lord will give him his reward. 

<sup>18</sup> Give your son training while there is hope; let not your heart be purposing his death. 

<sup>19</sup> A man of great wrath will have to take his punishment: for if you get him out of trouble you will have to do it again. 

<sup>20</sup> Let your ear be open to suggestion and take teaching, so that at the end you may be wise. 

<sup>21</sup> A man's heart may be full of designs, but the purpose of the Lord is unchanging. 

<sup>22</sup> The ornament of a man is his mercy, and a poor man is better than one who is false. 

<sup>23</sup> The fear of the Lord gives life: and he who has it will have need of nothing; no evil will come his way. 

<sup>24</sup> The hater of work puts his hand deep into the basin, and will not even take it to his mouth again. 

<sup>25</sup> When blows overtake the man of pride, the simple will get sense; say sharp words to the wise, and knowledge will be made clear to him. 

<sup>26</sup> He who is violent to his father, driving away his mother, is a son causing shame and a bad name. 

<sup>27</sup> A son who no longer gives attention to teaching is turned away from the words of knowledge. 

<sup>28</sup> A good-for-nothing witness makes sport of the judge's decision: and the mouth of evil-doers sends out evil like a stream. 

<sup>29</sup> Rods are being made ready for the man of pride, and blows for the back of the foolish.
