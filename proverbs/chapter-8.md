# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Is not wisdom crying out, and the voice of knowledge sounding? 

<sup>2</sup> At the top of the highways, at the meeting of the roads, she takes her place; 

<sup>3</sup> Where the roads go into the town her cry goes out, at the doorways her voice is loud: 

<sup>4</sup> I am crying out to you, O men; my voice comes to the sons of men. 

<sup>5</sup> Become expert in reason, O you simple ones; you foolish ones, take training to heart. 

<sup>6</sup> Give ear, for my words are true, and my lips are open to give out what is upright. 

<sup>7</sup> For good faith goes out of my mouth, and false lips are disgusting to me. 

<sup>8</sup> All the words of my mouth are righteousness; there is nothing false or twisted in them. 

<sup>9</sup> They are all true to him whose mind is awake, and straightforward to those who get knowledge. 

<sup>10</sup> Take my teaching, and not silver; get knowledge in place of the best gold. 

<sup>11</sup> For wisdom is better than jewels, and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her. 

<sup>12</sup> I, wisdom, have made wise behaviour my near relation; I am seen to be the special friend of wise purposes. 

<sup>13</sup> The fear of the Lord is seen in hating evil: pride, a high opinion of oneself, the evil way, and the false tongue, are unpleasing to me. 

<sup>14</sup> Wise design and good sense are mine; reason and strength are mine. 

<sup>15</sup> Through me kings have their power, and rulers give right decisions. 

<sup>16</sup> Through me chiefs have authority, and the noble ones are judging in righteousness. 

<sup>17</sup> Those who have given me their love are loved by me, and those who make search for me with care will get me. 

<sup>18</sup> Wealth and honour are in my hands, even wealth without equal and righteousness. 

<sup>19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, even than the best gold; and my increase is more to be desired than silver. 

<sup>20</sup> I go in the road of righteousness, in the way of right judging: 

<sup>21</sup> So that I may give my lovers wealth for their heritage, making their store-houses full. 

<sup>22</sup> The Lord made me as the start of his way, the first of his works in the past. 

<sup>23</sup> From eternal days I was given my place, from the birth of time, before the earth was. 

<sup>24</sup> When there was no deep I was given birth, when there were no fountains flowing with water. 

<sup>25</sup> Before the mountains were put in their places, before the hills was my birth: 

<sup>26</sup> When he had not made the earth or the fields or the dust of the world. 

<sup>27</sup> When he made ready the heavens I was there: when he put an arch over the face of the deep: 

<sup>28</sup> When he made strong the skies overhead: when the fountains of the deep were fixed: 

<sup>29</sup> When he put a limit to the sea, so that the waters might not go against his word: when he put in position the bases of the earth: 

<sup>30</sup> Then I was by his side, as a master workman: and I was his delight from day to day, playing before him at all times; 

<sup>31</sup> Playing in his earth; and my delight was with the sons of men. 

<sup>32</sup> Give ear to me then, my sons: for happy are those who keep my ways. 

<sup>33</sup> Take my teaching and be wise; do not let it go. 

<sup>34</sup> Happy is the man who gives ear to me, watching at my doors day by day, keeping his place by the pillars of my house. 

<sup>35</sup> For whoever gets me gets life, and grace from the Lord will come to him. 

<sup>36</sup> But he who does evil to me, does wrong to his soul: all my haters are in love with death.
