# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had given him no children; and she had a servant, a woman of Egypt whose name was Hagar.

<sup>2</sup> And Sarai said to Abram, See, the Lord has not let me have children; go in to my servant, for I may get a family through her. And Abram did as Sarai said.

<sup>3</sup> So after Abram had been living for ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian servant, and gave her to Abram for his wife.

<sup>4</sup> And he went in to Hagar and she became with child, and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for her master's wife.

<sup>5</sup> And Sarai said to Abram, May my wrong be on you: I gave you my servant for your wife and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for me: may the Lord be judge between you and me.

<sup>6</sup> And Abram said, The woman is in your power; do with her whatever seems good to you. And Sarai was cruel to her, so that she went running away from her.

<sup>7</sup> And an angel of the Lord came to her by a fountain of water in the waste land, by the fountain on the way to Shur.

<sup>8</sup> And he said, Hagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from and where are you going? And she said, I am running away from Sarai, my master's wife.

<sup>9</sup> And the angel said to her, Go back, and put yourself under her authority.

<sup>10</sup> And the angel of the Lord said, Your seed will be greatly increased so that it may not be numbered.

<sup>11</sup> And the angel of the Lord said, See, you are with child and will give birth to a son, to whom you will give the name Ishmael, because the ears of the Lord were open to your sorrow.

<sup>12</sup> And he will be like a mountain ass among men; his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him, and he will keep his place against all his brothers.

<sup>13</sup> And to the Lord who was talking with her she gave this name, You are a God who is seen; for she said, Have I not even here in the waste land had a vision of God and am still living?

<sup>14</sup> So that fountain was named, Fountain of Life and Vision: it is between Kadesh and Bered.

<sup>15</sup> And Hagar gave birth to a child, the son of Abram, to whom Abram gave the name of Ishmael.

<sup>16</sup> Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.
