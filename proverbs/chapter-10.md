# Chapter 10

**¹** A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother.

**²** Wealth which comes from sin is of no profit, but righteousness gives salvation from death.

**³** The Lord will not let the upright be in need of food, but he puts far from him the desire of the evil-doers.

**⁴** He who is slow in his work becomes poor, but the hand of the ready worker gets in wealth.

**⁵** He who in summer gets together his store is a son who does wisely; but he who takes his rest when the grain is being cut is a son causing shame.

**⁶** Blessings are on the head of the upright, but the face of sinners will be covered with sorrow.

**⁷** The memory of the upright is a blessing, but the name of the evil-doer will be turned to dust.

**⁸** The wise-hearted man will let himself be ruled, but the man whose talk is foolish will have a fall.

**⁹** He whose ways are upright will go safely, but he whose ways are twisted will be made low.

**¹⁰** He who makes signs with his eyes is a cause of trouble, but he who makes a man see his errors is a cause of peace.

**¹¹** The mouth of the upright man is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the evil-doer is a bitter cup.

**¹²** Hate is a cause of violent acts, but all errors are covered up by love.

**¹³** In the lips of him who has knowledge wisdom is seen; but a rod is ready for the back of him who is without sense.

**¹⁴** Knowledge is stored up by the wise, but the mouth of the foolish man is a destruction which is near.

**¹⁵** The property of the man of wealth is his strong town: the poor man's need is his destruction.

**¹⁶** The work of the upright gives life: the increase of the evil-doer is a cause of sin.

**¹⁷** He who takes note of teaching is a way of life, but he who gives up training is a cause of error.

**¹⁸** Hate is covered up by the lips of the upright man, but he who lets out evil about another is foolish.

**¹⁹** Where there is much talk there will be no end to sin, but he who keeps his mouth shut does wisely.

**²⁰** The tongue of the upright man is like tested silver: the heart of the evil-doer is of little value.

**²¹** The lips of the upright man give food to men, but the foolish come to death for need of sense.

**²²** The blessing of the Lord gives wealth: hard work makes it no greater.

**²³** It is sport to the foolish man to do evil, but the man of good sense takes delight in wisdom.

**²⁴** The thing feared by the evil-doer will come to him, but the upright man will get his desire.

**²⁵** When the storm-wind is past, the sinner is seen no longer, but the upright man is safe for ever.

**²⁶** Like acid drink to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes, so is the hater of work to those who send him.

**²⁷** The fear of the Lord gives long life, but the years of the evil-doer will be cut short.

**²⁸** The hope of the upright man will give joy, but the waiting of the evil-doer will have its end in sorrow.

**²⁹** The way of the Lord is a strong tower for the upright man, but destruction to the workers of evil.

**³⁰** The upright man will never be moved, but evil-doers will not have a safe resting-place in the land.

**³¹** The mouth of the upright man is budding with wisdom, but the twisted tongue will be cut off.

**³²** The lips of the upright man have knowledge of what is pleasing, but twisted are the mouths of evil-doers.
