# Psalm 8

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker on the Gittith. A Psalm. Of David. O Lord, our Lord, whose glory is higher than the heavens, how noble is your name in all the earth! 

<sup>2</sup> You have made clear your strength even out of the mouths of babies at the breast, because of those who are against you; so that you may put to shame the cruel and violent man. 

<sup>3</sup> When I see your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have put in their places; 

<sup>4</sup> What is man, that you keep him in mind? the son of man, that you take him into account? 

<sup>5</sup> For you have made him only a little lower than the gods, crowning him with glory and honour. 

<sup>6</sup> You have made him ruler over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet; 

<sup>7</sup> All sheep and oxen, and all the beasts of the field; 

<sup>8</sup> The birds of the air and the fish of the sea, and whatever goes through the deep waters of the seas. 

<sup>9</sup> O Lord, our Lord, how noble is your name in all the earth!
