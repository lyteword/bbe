# Psalm 139

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David. O Lord, you have knowledge of me, searching out all my secrets. 

<sup>2</sup> You have knowledge when I am seated and when I get up, you see my thoughts from far away. 

<sup>3</sup> You keep watch over my steps and my sleep, and have knowledge of all my ways. 

<sup>4</sup> For there is not a word on my tongue which is not clear to you, O Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> I am shut in by you on every side, and you have put your hand on me. 

<sup>6</sup> Such knowledge is a wonder greater than my powers; it is so high that I may not come near it. 

<sup>7</sup> Where may I go from your spirit? how may I go in flight from you? 

<sup>8</sup> If I go up to heaven, you are there: or if I make my bed in the underworld, you are there. 

<sup>9</sup> If I take the wings of the morning, and go to the farthest parts of the sea; 

<sup>10</sup> Even there will I be guided by your hand, and your right hand will keep me. 

<sup>11</sup> If I say, Only let me be covered by the dark, and the light about me be night; 

<sup>12</sup> Even the dark is not dark to you; the night is as bright as the day: for dark and light are the same to you. 

<sup>13</sup> My flesh was made by you, and my parts joined together in my mother's body. 

<sup>14</sup> I will give you praise, for I am strangely and delicately formed; your works are great wonders, and of this my soul is fully conscious. 

<sup>15</sup> My frame was not unseen by you when I was made secretly, and strangely formed in the lowest parts of the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book all my days were recorded, even those which were purposed before they had come into being. 

<sup>17</sup> How dear are your thoughts to me, O God! how great is the number of them! 

<sup>18</sup> If I made up their number, it would be more than the grains of sand; when I am awake, I am still with you. 

<sup>19</sup> If only you would put the sinners to death, O God; go far from me, you men of blood. 

<sup>20</sup> For they go against you with evil designs, and your haters make sport of your name. 

<sup>21</sup> Are not your haters hated by me, O Lord? are not those who are lifted up against you a cause of grief to me? 

<sup>22</sup> My hate for them is complete; my thoughts of them are as if they were making war on me. 

<sup>23</sup> O God, let the secrets of my heart be uncovered, and let my wandering thoughts be tested: 

<sup>24</sup> See if there is any way of sorrow in me, and be my guide in the eternal way.
