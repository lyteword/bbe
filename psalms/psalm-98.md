# Psalm 98

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. O make a new song to the Lord, because he has done works of wonder; with his right hand, and with his holy arm, he has overcome. 

<sup>2</sup> The Lord has given to all the knowledge of his salvation; he has made clear his righteousness in the eyes of the nations. 

<sup>3</sup> He has kept in mind his mercy and his unchanging faith to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 

<sup>4</sup> Let all the earth send out a glad cry to the Lord; sounding with a loud voice, and praising him with songs of joy. 

<sup>5</sup> Make melody to the Lord with instruments of music; with a corded instrument and the voice of song. 

<sup>6</sup> With wind instruments and the sound of the horn, make a glad cry before the Lord, the King. 

<sup>7</sup> Let the sea be thundering, with all its waters; the world, and all who are living in it; 

<sup>8</sup> Let the streams make sounds of joy with their hands; let the mountains be glad together, 

<sup>9</sup> Before the Lord, for he has come as judge of the earth; judging the world in righteousness, and giving true decisions for the peoples.
