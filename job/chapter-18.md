# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> How long will it be before you have done talking? Get wisdom, and then we will say what is in our minds. 

<sup>3</sup> Why do we seem as beasts in your eyes, and as completely without knowledge? 

<sup>4</sup> But come back, now, come: you who are wounding yourself in your passion, will the earth be given up because of you, or a rock be moved out of its place? 

<sup>5</sup> For the light of the sinner is put out, and the flame of his fire is not shining. 

<sup>6</sup> The light is dark in his tent, and the light shining over him is put out. 

<sup>7</sup> The steps of his strength become short, and by his design destruction overtakes him. 

<sup>8</sup> His feet take him into the net, and he goes walking into the cords. 

<sup>9</sup> His foot is taken in the net; he comes into its grip. 

<sup>10</sup> The twisted cord is put secretly in the earth to take him, and the cord is placed in his way. 

<sup>11</sup> He is overcome by fears on every side, they go after him at every step. 

<sup>12</sup> His strength is made feeble for need of food, and destruction is waiting for his falling footstep. 

<sup>13</sup> His skin is wasted by disease, and his body is food for the worst of diseases. 

<sup>14</sup> He is pulled out of his tent where he was safe, and he is taken away to the king of fears. 

<sup>15</sup> In his tent will be seen that which is not his, burning stone is dropped on his house. 

<sup>16</sup> Under the earth his roots are dry, and over it his branch is cut off. 

<sup>17</sup> His memory is gone from the earth, and in the open country there is no knowledge of his name. 

<sup>18</sup> He is sent away from the light into the dark; he is forced out of the world. 

<sup>19</sup> He has no offspring or family among his people, and in his living-place there is no one of his name. 

<sup>20</sup> At his fate those of the west are shocked, and those of the east are overcome with fear. 

<sup>21</sup> Truly, these are the houses of the sinner, and this is the place of him who has no knowledge of God.
