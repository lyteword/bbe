# Psalm 110

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Of David. The Lord said to my lord, Be seated at my right hand, till I put all those who are against you under your feet. 

<sup>2</sup> The Lord will send out the rod of your strength from Zion; be king over your haters. 

<sup>3</sup> Your people give themselves gladly in the day of your power; like the dew of the morning on the holy mountains is the army of your young men. 

<sup>4</sup> The Lord has made an oath, and will not take it back. You are a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek. 

<sup>5</sup> In the day of his wrath kings will be wounded by the Lord at your right hand. 

<sup>6</sup> He will be judge among the nations, the valleys will be full of dead bodies; the head over a great country will be wounded by him. 

<sup>7</sup> He will take of the stream by the way; so his head will be lifted up.
