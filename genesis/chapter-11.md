# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> And all the earth had one language and one tongue. 

<sup>2</sup> And it came about that in their wandering from the east, they came to a stretch of flat country in the land of Shinar, and there they made their living-place. 

<sup>3</sup> And they said one to another, Come, let us make bricks, burning them well. And they had bricks for stone, putting them together with sticky earth. 

<sup>4</sup> And they said, Come, let us make a town, and a tower whose top will go up as high as heaven; and let us make a great name for ourselves, so that we may not be wanderers over the face of the earth. 

<sup>5</sup> And the Lord came down to see the town and the tower which the children of men were building. 

<sup>6</sup> And the Lord said, See, they are all one people and have all one language; and this is only the start of what they may do: and now it will not be possible to keep them from any purpose of theirs. 

<sup>7</sup> Come, let us go down and take away the sense of their language, so that they will not be able to make themselves clear to one another. 

<sup>8</sup> So the Lord God sent them away into every part of the earth: and they gave up building their town. 

<sup>9</sup> So it was named Babel, because there the Lord took away the sense of all languages and from there the Lord sent them away over all the face of the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad, two years after the great flow of waters; 

<sup>11</sup> And after the birth of Arpachshad, Shem went on living for five hundred years, and had sons and daughters: 

<sup>12</sup> And Arpachshad was thirty-five years old when he became the father of Shelah: 

<sup>13</sup> And after the birth of Shelah, Arpachshad went on living for four hundred and three years, and had sons and daughters: 

<sup>14</sup> And Shelah was thirty years old when he became the father of Eber: 

<sup>15</sup> And after the birth of Eber, Shelah went on living for four hundred and three years, and had sons and daughters: 

<sup>16</sup> And Eber was thirty-four years old when he became the father of Peleg: 

<sup>17</sup> And after the birth of Peleg, Eber went on living for four hundred and thirty years, and had sons and daughters: 

<sup>18</sup> And Peleg was thirty years old when he became the father of Reu: 

<sup>19</sup> And after the birth of Reu, Peleg went on living for two hundred and nine years, and had sons and daughters: 

<sup>20</sup> And Reu was thirty-two years old when he became the father of Serug: 

<sup>21</sup> And after the birth of Serug, Reu went on living for two hundred and seven years, and had sons and daughters: 

<sup>22</sup> And Serug was thirty years old when he became the father of Nahor: 

<sup>23</sup> And after the birth of Nahor, Serug went on living for two hundred years, and had sons and daughters: 

<sup>24</sup> And Nahor was twenty-nine years old when he became the father of Terah: 

<sup>25</sup> And after the birth of Terah, Nahor went on living for a hundred and nineteen years, and had sons and daughters: 

<sup>26</sup> And Terah was seventy years old when he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 

<sup>27</sup> These are the generations of Terah: Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot. 

<sup>28</sup> And death came to Haran when he was with his father Terah in the land of his birth, Ur of the Chaldees. 

<sup>29</sup> And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah. 

<sup>30</sup> And Sarai had no child. 

<sup>31</sup> And Terah took Abram, his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, and Sarai, his daughter-in-law, the wife of his son Abram and they went out from Ur of the Chaldees, to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and were there for some time. 

<sup>32</sup> And all the years of Terah's life were two hundred and five: and Terah came to his end in Haran.
