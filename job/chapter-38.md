# Chapter 38

<sup>1</sup> And the Lord made answer to Job out of the storm-wind, and said,

<sup>2</sup> Who is this who makes the purpose of God dark by words without knowledge?

<sup>3</sup> Get your strength together like a man of war; I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers.

<sup>4</sup> Where were you when I put the earth on its base? Say, if you have knowledge.

<sup>5</sup> By whom were its measures fixed? Say, if you have wisdom; or by whom was the line stretched out over it?

<sup>6</sup> On what were its pillars based, or who put down its angle-stone,

<sup>7</sup> When the morning stars made songs together, and all the sons of the gods gave cries of joy?

<sup>8</sup> Or where were you when the sea came to birth, pushing out from its secret place;

<sup>9</sup> When I made the cloud its robe, and put thick clouds as bands round it,

<sup>10</sup> Ordering a fixed limit for it, with locks and doors;

<sup>11</sup> And said, So far you may come, and no farther; and here the pride of your waves will be stopped?

<sup>12</sup> Have you, from your earliest days, given orders to the morning, or made the dawn conscious of its place;

<sup>13</sup> So that it might take a grip of the skirts of the earth, shaking all the evil-doers out of it?

<sup>14</sup> It is changed like wet earth under a stamp, and is coloured like a robe;

<sup>15</sup> And from the evil-doers their light is kept back, and the arm of pride is broken.

<sup>16</sup> Have you come into the springs of the sea, walking in the secret places of the deep?

<sup>17</sup> Have the doors of death been open to you, or have the door-keepers of the dark ever seen you?

<sup>18</sup> Have you taken note of the wide limits of the earth? Say, if you have knowledge of it all.

<sup>19</sup> Which is the way to the resting-place of the light, and where is the store-house of the dark;

<sup>20</sup> So that you might take it to its limit, guiding it to its house?

<sup>21</sup> No doubt you have knowledge of it, for then you had come to birth, and the number of your days is great.

<sup>22</sup> Have you come into the secret place of snow, or have you seen the store-houses of the ice-drops,

<sup>23</sup> Which I have kept for the time of trouble, for the day of war and fighting?

<sup>24</sup> Which is the way to the place where the wind is measured out, and the east wind sent out over the earth?

<sup>25</sup> By whom has the way been cut for the flowing of the rain, and the flaming of the thunder;

<sup>26</sup> Causing rain to come on a land where no man is living, on the waste land which has no people;

<sup>27</sup> To give water to the land where there is waste and destruction, and to make the dry land green with young grass?

<sup>28</sup> Has the rain a father? or who gave birth to the drops of night mist?

<sup>29</sup> Out of whose body came the ice? and who gave birth to the cold mist of heaven?

<sup>30</sup> The waters are joined together, hard as a stone, and the face of the deep is covered.

<sup>31</sup> Are the bands of the Pleiades fixed by you, or are the cords of Orion made loose?

<sup>32</sup> Do you make Mazzaroth come out in its right time, or are the Bear and its children guided by you?

<sup>33</sup> Have you knowledge of the laws of the heavens? did you give them rule over the earth?

<sup>34</sup> Is your voice sent up to the cloud, so that you may be covered by the weight of waters?

<sup>35</sup> Do you send out the thunder-flames, so that they may go, and say to you, Here we are?

<sup>36</sup> Who has put wisdom in the high clouds, or given knowledge to the lights of the north?

<sup>37</sup> By whose wisdom are the clouds numbered, or the water-skins of the heavens turned to the earth,

<sup>38</sup> When the earth becomes hard as metal, and is joined together in masses?

<sup>39</sup> Do you go after food for the she-lion, or get meat so that the young lions may have enough,

<sup>40</sup> When they are stretched out in their holes, and are waiting in the brushwood?

<sup>41</sup> Who gives in the evening the meat he is searching for, when his young ones are crying to God; when the young lions with loud noise go wandering after their food?
