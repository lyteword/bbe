# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Keep in mind, O Lord, what has come to us: take note and see our shame. 

<sup>2</sup> Our heritage is given up to men of strange lands, our houses to those who are not our countrymen. 

<sup>3</sup> We are children without fathers, our mothers are like widows. 

<sup>4</sup> We give money for a drink of water, we get our wood for a price. 

<sup>5</sup> Our attackers are on our necks: overcome with weariness, we have no rest. 

<sup>6</sup> We have given our hands to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians so that we might have enough bread. 

<sup>7</sup> Our fathers were sinners and are dead; and the weight of their evil-doing is on us. 

<sup>8</sup> Servants are ruling over us, and there is no one to make us free from their hands. 

<sup>9</sup> We put our lives in danger to get our bread, because of the sword of the waste land. 

<sup>10</sup> Our skin is heated like an oven because of our burning heat from need of food. 

<sup>11</sup> They took by force the women in Zion, the virgins in the towns of Judah. 

<sup>12</sup> Their hands put princes to death by hanging: the faces of old men were not honoured. 

<sup>13</sup> The young men were crushing the grain, and the boys were falling under the wood. 

<sup>14</sup> The old men are no longer seated in the doorway, and the music of the young men has come to an end. 

<sup>15</sup> The joy of our hearts is ended; our dancing is changed into sorrow. 

<sup>16</sup> The crown has been taken from our head: sorrow is ours, for we are sinners. 

<sup>17</sup> Because of this our hearts are feeble; for these things our eyes are dark; 

<sup>18</sup> Because of the mountain of Zion which is a waste; jackals go over it. 

<sup>19</sup> You, O Lord, are seated as King for ever; the seat of your power is eternal. 

<sup>20</sup> Why have we gone from your memory for ever? why have you been turned away from us for so long? 

<sup>21</sup> Make us come back to you, O Lord, and let us be turned; make our days new again as in the past. 

<sup>22</sup> But you have quite given us up; you are full of wrath against us.
