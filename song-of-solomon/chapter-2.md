# Chapter 2

**¹** I am a rose of Sharon, a flower of the valleys.

**²** As the lily-flower among the thorns of the waste, so is my love among the daughters.

**³** As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my loved one among the sons. I took my rest under his shade with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

**⁴** He took me to the house of wine, and his flag over me was love.

**⁵** Make me strong with wine-cakes, let me be comforted with apples; I am overcome with love.

**⁶** His left hand is under my head, and his right hand is round about me.

**⁷** I say to you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes of the field, do not let love be moved till it is ready.

**⁸** The voice of my loved one! See, he comes dancing on the mountains, stepping quickly on the hills.

**⁹** My loved one is like a roe; see, he is on the other side of our wall, he is looking in at the windows, letting himself be seen through the spaces.

**¹⁰** My loved one said to me, Get up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

**¹¹** For, see, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;

**¹²** The flowers are come on the earth; the time of cutting the vines is come, and the voice of the dove is sounding in our land;

**¹³** The fig-tree puts out her green fruit and the vines with their young fruit give a good smell. Get up from your bed, my beautiful one, and come away.

**¹⁴** O my dove, you are in the holes of the mountain sides, in the cracks of the high hills; let me see your face, let your voice come to my ears; for sweet is your voice, and your face is fair.

**¹⁵** Take for us the foxes, the little foxes, which do damage to the vines; our vines have young grapes.

**¹⁶** My loved one is mine, and I am his: he takes his food among the flowers.

**¹⁷** Till the evening comes, and the sky slowly becomes dark, come, my loved one, and be like a roe on the mountains of Bether.
