# Psalm 94 

**¹** O God, in whose hands is punishment, O God of punishment, let your shining face be seen.

**²** Be lifted up, O judge of the earth; let their reward come to the men of pride.

**³** How long will sinners, O Lord, how long will sinners have joy over us?

**⁴** Words of pride come from their lips; all the workers of evil say great things of themselves.

**⁵** Your people are crushed by them, O Lord, your heritage is troubled,

**⁶** They put to death the widow and the guest, they take the lives of children who have no father;

**⁷** And they say, Jah will not see it, the God of Jacob will not give thought to it.

**⁸** Give your mind to my words, you who are without wisdom among the people; you foolish men, when will you be wise?

**⁹** Has he by whom your ears were planted no hearing? or is he blind by whom your eyes were formed?

**¹⁰** He who is the judge of the nations, will he not give men the reward of their acts, even he who gives knowledge to man?

**¹¹** The Lord has knowledge of the thoughts of man, for they are only a breath.

**¹²** Happy is the man who is guided by you, O Jah, and to whom you give teaching out of your law;

**¹³** So that you may give him rest from the days of evil, till a hole is made ready for the destruction of the sinners.

**¹⁴** The Lord will not give up his people, or take away his support from his heritage;

**¹⁵** But decisions will again be made in righteousness; and they will be kept by all whose hearts are true.

**¹⁶** Who will give me help against the sinners? and who will be my support against the workers of evil?

**¹⁷** If the Lord had not been my helper, my soul would quickly have gone down into death.

**¹⁸** If I say, My foot is slipping; your mercy, O Lord, is my support.

**¹⁹** Among all my troubled thoughts, your comforts are the delight of my soul.

**²⁰** What part with you has the seat of sin, which makes evil into a law?

**²¹** They are banded together against the soul of the upright, to give decisions against those who have done no wrong.

**²²** But the Lord is my safe resting-place; my God is the Rock where I am safe.

**²³** And he has made their evil designs come back on themselves, cutting them off in their sin; the Lord our God will put an end to them.
