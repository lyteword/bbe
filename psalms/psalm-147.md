# Psalm 147

**¹** Give praise to the Lord; for it is good to make melody to our God; praise is pleasing and beautiful.

**²** The Lord is building up Jerusalem; he makes all the outlaws of Israel come together.

**³** He makes the broken-hearted well, and puts oil on their wounds.

**⁴** He sees the number of the stars; he gives them all their names.

**⁵** Great is our Lord, and great his power; there is no limit to his wisdom.

**⁶** The Lord gives help to the poor in spirit; but he sends sinners down in shame.

**⁷** Make songs of praise to the Lord; make melody to our God with instruments of music.

**⁸** By his hand the heaven is covered with clouds and rain is stored up for the earth; he makes the grass tall on the mountains.

**⁹** He gives food to every beast, and to the young ravens in answer to their cry.

**¹⁰** He has no delight in the strength of a horse; he takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.

**¹¹** The Lord takes pleasure in his worshippers, and in those whose hope is in his mercy.

**¹²** Give praise to the Lord, O Jerusalem; give praise to your God, O Zion.

**¹³** He has made strong the iron bands of your doors; he has sent blessings on your children inside your walls.

**¹⁴** He gives peace in all your land, making your stores full of fat grain.

**¹⁵** He sends out his orders to the earth; his word goes out quickly.

**¹⁶** He gives snow like wool; he sends out ice-drops like dust.

**¹⁷** He sends down ice like raindrops: water is made hard by his cold.

**¹⁸** At the outgoing of his word, the ice is turned to water; when he sends out his wind, there is a flowing of waters.

**¹⁹** He makes his word clear to Jacob, teaching Israel his laws and his decisions.

**²⁰** He has not done these things for any other nation: and as for his laws, they have no knowledge of them. Let the Lord be praised.
