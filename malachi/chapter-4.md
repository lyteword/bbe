# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> For see, the day is coming, it is burning like an oven; all the men of pride and all who do evil will be dry stems of grass: and in the day which is coming they will be burned up, says the Lord of armies, till they have not a root or a branch. 

<sup>2</sup> But to you who give worship to my name, the sun of righteousness will come up with new life in its wings; and you will go out, playing like young oxen full of food. 

<sup>3</sup> And the evil-doers will be crushed under you, they will be dust under your feet, in the day when I do my work, says the Lord of armies. 

<sup>4</sup> Keep in mind the law of Moses, my servant, which I gave him in Horeb for all Israel, even the rules and the decisions. 

<sup>5</sup> See, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the day of the Lord comes, that great day, greatly to be feared. 

<sup>6</sup> And by him the hearts of fathers will be turned to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers; for fear that I may come and put the earth under a curse.
