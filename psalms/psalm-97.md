# Psalm 97

<sup>1</sup> The Lord is King, let the earth have joy; let all the sea-lands be glad.

<sup>2</sup> Dark clouds are round him; his kingdom is based on righteousness and right judging.

<sup>3</sup> Fire goes before him, burning up all those who are against him round about.

<sup>4</sup> His bright flames give light to the world; the earth saw it with fear.

<sup>5</sup> The mountains became like wax at the coming of the Lord, at the coming of the Lord of all the earth.

<sup>6</sup> The heavens gave out the news of his righteousness, and all the people saw his glory.

<sup>7</sup> Shamed be all those who give worship to images, and take pride in false gods; give him worship, all you gods.

<sup>8</sup> Zion gave ear and was glad; and the daughters of Judah were full of joy, because of your decisions, O Lord.

<sup>9</sup> For you, Lord, are most high over the earth; you are lifted up over all other gods.

<sup>10</sup> You who are lovers of the Lord, be haters of evil; he keeps the souls of his saints; he takes them out of the hand of sinners.

<sup>11</sup> Light is shining on the lovers of righteousness, and for the upright in heart there is joy.

<sup>12</sup> Be glad in the Lord, you upright men; praising the memory of his holy name.
