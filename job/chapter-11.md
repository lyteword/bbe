# Chapter 11

**¹** Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said,

**²** Are all these words to go unanswered? and is a man seen to be right because he is full of talk?

**³** Are your words of pride to make men keep quiet? and are you to make sport, with no one to put you to shame?

**⁴** You may say, My way is clean, and I am free from sin in your eyes.

**⁵** But if only God would take up the word, opening his lips in argument with you;

**⁶** And would make clear to you the secrets of wisdom, and the wonders of his purpose!

**⁷** Are you able to take God's measure, to make discovery of the limits of the Ruler of all?

**⁸** They are higher than heaven; what is there for you to do? deeper than the underworld, and outside your knowledge;

**⁹** Longer in measure than the earth, and wider than the sea.

**¹⁰** If he goes on his way, shutting a man up and putting him to death, who may make him go back from his purpose?

**¹¹** For in his eyes men are as nothing; he sees evil and takes note of it.

**¹²** And so a hollow-minded man will get wisdom, when a young ass of the field gets teaching.

**¹³** But if you put your heart right, stretching out your hands to him;

**¹⁴** If you put far away the evil of your hands, and let no wrongdoing have a place in your tent;

**¹⁵** Then truly your face will be lifted up, with no mark of sin, and you will be fixed in your place without fear:

**¹⁶** For your sorrow will go from your memory, like waters flowing away:

**¹⁷** And your life will be brighter than day; though it is dark, it will become like the morning.

**¹⁸** And you will be safe because there is hope; after looking round, you will take your rest in quiet;

**¹⁹** Sleeping with no fear of danger; and men will be desiring to have grace in your eyes;

**²⁰** But the eyes of the evil-doers will be wasting away; their way of flight is gone, and their only hope is the taking of their last breath.
