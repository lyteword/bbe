# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> And Job made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Truly, I see that it is so: and how is it possible for a man to get his right before God? 

<sup>3</sup> If a man was desiring to go to law with him, he would not be able to give him an answer to one out of a thousand questions. 

<sup>4</sup> He is wise in heart and great in strength: who ever made his face hard against him, and any good came of it? 

<sup>5</sup> It is he who takes away the mountains without their knowledge, overturning them in his wrath: 

<sup>6</sup> Who is moving the earth out of its place, so that its pillars are shaking: 

<sup>7</sup> Who gives orders to the sun, and it does not give its light; and who keeps the stars from shining. 

<sup>8</sup> By whose hand the heavens were stretched out, and who is walking on the waves of the sea: 

<sup>9</sup> Who made the Bear and Orion, and the Pleiades, and the store-houses of the south: 

<sup>10</sup> Who does great things not to be searched out; yes, wonders without number. 

<sup>11</sup> See, he goes past me and I see him not: he goes on before, but I have no knowledge of him. 

<sup>12</sup> If he puts out his hand to take, by whom may it be turned back? who may say to him, What are you doing? 

<sup>13</sup> God's wrath may not be turned back; the helpers of Rahab were bent down under him. 

<sup>14</sup> How much less may I give an answer to him, using the right words in argument with him? 

<sup>15</sup> Even if my cause was good, I would not be able to give an answer; I would make request for grace from him who was against me. 

<sup>16</sup> If I had sent for him to be present, and he had come, I would have no faith that he would give ear to my voice. 

<sup>17</sup> For I would be crushed by his storm, my wounds would be increased without cause. 

<sup>18</sup> He would not let me take my breath, but I would be full of bitter grief. 

<sup>19</sup> If it is a question of strength, he says, Here I am! and if it is a question of a cause at law, he says, Who will give me a fixed day? 

<sup>20</sup> Though I was in the right, he would say that I was in the wrong; I have done no evil; but he says that I am a sinner. 

<sup>21</sup> I have done no wrong; I give no thought to what becomes of me; I have no desire for life. 

<sup>22</sup> It is all the same to me; so I say, He puts an end to the sinner and to him who has done no wrong together. 

<sup>23</sup> If death comes suddenly through disease, he makes sport of the fate of those who have done no wrong. 

<sup>24</sup> The land is given into the power of the evil-doer; the faces of its judges are covered; if not by him, then who has done it? 

<sup>25</sup> My days go quicker than a post-runner: they go in flight, they see no good. 

<sup>26</sup> They go rushing on like reed-boats, like an eagle dropping suddenly on its food. 

<sup>27</sup> If I say, I will put my grief out of mind, I will let my face be sad no longer and I will be bright; 

<sup>28</sup> I go in fear of all my pains; I am certain that I will not be free from sin in your eyes. 

<sup>29</sup> You will not let me be clear of sin! why then do I take trouble for nothing? 

<sup>30</sup> If I am washed with snow water, and make my hands clean with soap; 

<sup>31</sup> Then you will have me pushed into the dust, so that I will seem disgusting to my very clothing. 

<sup>32</sup> For he is not a man as I am, that I might give him an answer, that we might come together before a judge. 

<sup>33</sup> There is no one to give a decision between us, who might have control over us. 

<sup>34</sup> Let him take away his rod from me and not send his fear on me: 

<sup>35</sup> Then I would say what is in my mind without fear of him; for there is no cause of fear in myself.
