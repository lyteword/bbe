# Psalm 96

<sup>1</sup> O make a new song to the Lord; let all the earth make melody to the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> Make songs to the Lord, blessing his name; give the good news of his salvation day by day. 

<sup>3</sup> Make clear his glory to the nations, and his wonders to all the peoples. 

<sup>4</sup> For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; he is more to be feared than all other gods. 

<sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the nations are false gods; but the Lord made the heavens. 

<sup>6</sup> Honour and glory are before him: strong and fair is his holy place. 

<sup>7</sup> Give to the Lord, O you families of the peoples, give to the Lord glory and strength. 

<sup>8</sup> Give to the Lord the glory of his name; take with you an offering and come into his house. 

<sup>9</sup> O give worship to the Lord in holy robes; be in fear before him, all the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Say among the nations, The Lord is King; yes, the world is ordered so that it may not be moved; he will be an upright judge of the peoples. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the heavens have joy and the earth be glad; let the sea be thundering with all its waters; 

<sup>12</sup> Let the field be glad, and everything which is in it; yes, let all the trees of the wood be sounding with joy, 

<sup>13</sup> Before the Lord, for he is come; he is come to be the judge of the earth; the earth will be judged in righteousness, and the peoples with unchanging faith.
