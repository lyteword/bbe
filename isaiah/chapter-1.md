# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw about Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 

<sup>2</sup> Give ear, O heavens, and you, O earth, to the word which the Lord has said: I have taken care of my children till they became men, but their hearts have been turned away from me. 

<sup>3</sup> Even the ox has knowledge of its owner, and the ass of the place where its master puts its food: but Israel has no knowledge, my people give no thought to me. 

<sup>4</sup> O nation full of sin, a people weighted down with crime, a generation of evil-doers, false-hearted children: they have gone away from the Lord, they have no respect for the Holy One of Israel, their hearts are turned back from him. 

<sup>5</sup> Why will you have more and more punishment? why keep on in your evil ways? Every head is tired and every heart is feeble. 

<sup>6</sup> The body, from head to foot, is all diseased; it is a mass of open wounds, marks of blows, and broken flesh: the flow of blood has not been stopped, and no oil has been put on the wounds. 

<sup>7</sup> Your country has become waste; your towns are burned with fire; as for your land, it is overturned before your eyes, made waste and overcome by men from strange lands. 

<sup>8</sup> And the daughter of Zion has become like a tent in a vine-garden, like a watchman's house in a field of fruit, like a town shut in by armies. 

<sup>9</sup> If the Lord of armies had not kept some at least of us safe, we would have been like Sodom, and the fate of Gomorrah would have been ours. 

<sup>10</sup> Give ear to the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; let your hearts be turned to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah. 

<sup>11</sup> What use to me is the number of the offerings which you give me? says the Lord; your burned offerings of sheep, and the best parts of fat cattle, are a weariness to me; I take no pleasure in the blood of oxen, or of lambs, or of he-goats. 

<sup>12</sup> At whose request do you come before me, making my house unclean with your feet? 

<sup>13</sup> Give me no more false offerings; the smoke of burning flesh is disgusting to me, so are your new moons and Sabbaths and your holy meetings. 

<sup>14</sup> Your new moons and your regular feasts are a grief to my soul: they are a weight in my spirit; I am crushed under them. 

<sup>15</sup> And when your hands are stretched out to me, my eyes will be turned away from you: even though you go on making prayers, I will not give ear: your hands are full of blood. 

<sup>16</sup> Be washed, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; let there be an end of sinning; 

<sup>17</sup> Take pleasure in well-doing; let your ways be upright, keep down the cruel, give a right decision for the child who has no father, see to the cause of the widow. 

<sup>18</sup> Come now, and let us have an argument together, says the Lord: how may your sins which are red like blood be white as snow? how may their dark purple seem like wool? 

<sup>19</sup> If you will give ear to my word and do it, the good things of the land will be yours; 

<sup>20</sup> But if your hearts are turned against me, I will send destruction on you by the sword; so the Lord has said. 

<sup>21</sup> The upright town has become untrue; there was a time when her judges gave right decisions, when righteousness had a resting-place in her, but now she is full of those who take men's lives. 

<sup>22</sup> Your silver is no longer true metal, your wine is mixed with water. 

<sup>23</sup> Your chiefs have gone against the Lord, they have become friends of thieves; every one of them is looking for profit and going after rewards; they do not give right decisions for the child who has no father, and they do not let the cause of the widow come before them. 

<sup>24</sup> For this reason the Lord, the Lord of armies, the Strong One of Israel, has said, I will put an end to my haters, and send punishment on those who are against me; 

<sup>25</sup> And my hand will again be on you, washing away what is unclean as with soap, and taking away all your false metal; 

<sup>26</sup> And I will give you judges again as at the first, and wise guides as in the past; then you will be named, The Town of Righteousness, the true town. 

<sup>27</sup> Upright acts will be the price of Zion's forgiveness, and by righteousness will men be living there. 

<sup>28</sup> But a common destruction will overtake sinners and evil-doers together, and those who have gone away from the Lord will be cut off. 

<sup>29</sup> For you will be put to shame because of the trees of your desire, and because of the gardens of your pleasure. 

<sup>30</sup> For you will be like a tree whose leaves have become dry, and like a garden without water. 

<sup>31</sup> And the strong will be as food for the fire, and his work as a flame; and they will be burned together, with no one to put out the fire.
