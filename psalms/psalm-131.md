# Psalm 131 

A Song of the going up. Of David.

**¹** Lord, there is no pride in my heart and my eyes are not lifted up; and I have not taken part in great undertakings, or in things over-hard for me.

**²** See, I have made my soul calm and quiet, like a child on its mother's breast; my soul is like a child on its mother's breast.

**³** O Israel, have hope in the Lord, from this time and for ever.
