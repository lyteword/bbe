# Psalm 61

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. On a corded instrument. Of David. Let my cry come to you, O God; let your ears be open to my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> From the end of the earth will I send up my cry to you, when my heart is overcome: take me to the rock which is over-high for me. 

<sup>3</sup> For you have been my secret place, and my high tower from those who made war on me. 

<sup>4</sup> I will make your tent my resting-place for ever: I will keep myself under the cover of your wings. (Selah.) 

<sup>5</sup> For you, O God, have made answer to my prayers; you have given me the heritage of those who give honour to your name. 

<sup>6</sup> You will give the king long life; and make his years go on through the generations. 

<sup>7</sup> May the seat of his authority be before God for ever; may mercy and righteousness keep him safe. 

<sup>8</sup> So will I make songs in praise of your name for ever, giving to God that which is right day by day.
