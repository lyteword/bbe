# Psalm 36

To the chief music-maker. Of the servant of the Lord. Of David.

**¹** The sin of the evil-doer says in his heart, There is no fear of the Lord before his eyes.

**²** For he takes comfort in the thought that his sin will not be uncovered and hated.

**³** In the words of his mouth are evil and deceit; he has given up being wise and doing good.

**⁴** He gives thought to evil on his bed; he takes a way which is not good; he is not a hater of evil.

**⁵** Your mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and your strong purpose is as high as the clouds.

**⁶** Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judging is like the great deep; O Lord, you give life to man and beast.

**⁷** How good is your loving mercy, O God! the children of men take cover under the shade of your wings.

**⁸** The delights of your house will be showered on them; you will give them drink from the river of your pleasures.

**⁹** For with you is the fountain of life: in your light we will see light.

**¹⁰** O let there be no end to your loving mercy to those who have knowledge of you, or of your righteousness to the upright in heart.

**¹¹** Let not the foot of pride come against me, or the hand of the evil-doers put me out of my place.

**¹²** There the workers of evil have come down: they have been made low, and will not be lifted up.
