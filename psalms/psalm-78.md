# Psalm 78

Maschil. Of Asaph.

**¹** Give ear, O my people, to my law; let your ears be bent down to the words of my mouth.

**²** Opening my mouth I will give out a story, even the dark sayings of old times;

**³** Which have come to our hearing and our knowledge, as they were given to us by our fathers.

**⁴** We will not keep them secret from our children; we will make clear to the coming generation the praises of the Lord and his strength, and the great works of wonder which he has done.

**⁵** He put up a witness in Jacob, and made a law in Israel; which he gave to our fathers so that they might give knowledge of them to their children;

**⁶** So that the generation to come might have knowledge of them, even the children of the future, who would give word of them to their children;

**⁷** So that they might put their hope in God, and not let God's works go out of their minds, but keep his laws;

**⁸** And not be like their fathers, a stiff-necked and uncontrolled generation; a generation whose heart was hard, whose spirit was not true to God.

**⁹** The children of Ephraim, armed with bows, were turned back on the day of the fight.

**¹⁰** They were not ruled by God's word, and they would not go in the way of his law;

**¹¹** They let his works go out of their memory, and the wonders which he had made them see.

**¹²** He did great works before the eyes of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.

**¹³** The sea was cut in two so that they might go through; the waters were massed together on this side and on that.

**¹⁴** In the daytime he was guiding them in the cloud, and all through the night with a light of fire.

**¹⁵** The rocks of the waste land were broken by his power, and he gave them drink as out of the deep waters.

**¹⁶** He made streams come out of the rock; and waters came flowing down like rivers.

**¹⁷** And they went on sinning against him even more, turning away from the Most High in the waste land;

**¹⁸** Testing God in their hearts, requesting meat for their desire.

**¹⁹** They said bitter words against God, saying, Is God able to make ready a table in the waste land?

**²⁰** See, the rock was cut open by his power, so that the water came rushing out, and overflowing streams; is he able to give us bread? is he able to get meat for his people?

**²¹** So these things came to the Lord's ears, and he was angry; and a fire was lighted against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel;

**²²** Because they had no faith in God, and no hope in his salvation.

**²³** And he gave orders to the clouds on high, and the doors of heaven were open;

**²⁴** And he sent down manna like rain for their food, and gave them the grain of heaven.

**²⁵** Man took part in the food of strong ones; he sent them meat in full measure.

**²⁶** He sent an east wind from heaven, driving on the south wind by his power.

**²⁷** He sent down meat on them like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the sea,

**²⁸** And he let it come down into their resting-place, round about their tents.

**²⁹** So they had food and were full; for he gave them their desire;

**³⁰** But they were not turned from their desires; and while the food was still in their mouths,

**³¹** The wrath of God came on them, and put to death the fattest of them, and put an end to the young men of Israel.

**³²** For all this they went on sinning even more, and had no faith in his great wonders.

**³³** So their days were wasted like a breath, and their years in trouble.

**³⁴** When he sent death on them, then they made search for him; turning to him and looking for him with care;

**³⁵** In the memory that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their saviour.

**³⁶** But their lips were false to him, and their tongues were untrue to him;

**³⁷** And their hearts were not right with him, and they did not keep their agreement with him.

**³⁸** But he, being full of pity, has forgiveness for sin, and does not put an end to man: frequently turning back his wrath, and not being violently angry.

**³⁹** So he kept in mind that they were only flesh; a breath which is quickly gone, and will not come again.

**⁴⁰** How frequently did they go against him in the waste land, and give him cause for grief in the dry places!

**⁴¹** Again they put God to the test, and gave pain to the Holy One of Israel.

**⁴²** They did not keep in mind the work of his hand, or the day when he took them from the power of their haters;

**⁴³** How he had done his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan;

**⁴⁴** So that their rivers were turned to blood, and they were not able to get drink from their streams.

**⁴⁵** He sent different sorts of flies among them, poisoning their flesh; and frogs for their destruction.

**⁴⁶** He gave the increase of their fields to worms, the fruits of their industry to the locusts.

**⁴⁷** He sent ice for the destruction of their vines; their trees were damaged by the bitter cold.

**⁴⁸** Ice was rained down on their cattle; thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks.

**⁴⁹** He sent on them the heat of his wrath, his bitter disgust, letting loose evil angels among them.

**⁵⁰** He let his wrath have its way; he did not keep back their soul from death, but gave their life to disease.

**⁵¹** He gave to destruction all the first sons of Egypt; the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;

**⁵²** But he took his people out like sheep, guiding them in the waste land like a flock.

**⁵³** He took them on safely so that they had no fear; but their haters were covered by the sea.

**⁵⁴** And he was their guide to his holy land, even to the mountain, which his right hand had made his;

**⁵⁵** Driving out nations before them, marking out the line of their heritage, and giving the people of Israel their tents for a resting-place.

**⁵⁶** But they were bitter against the Most High God, testing him, and not keeping his laws;

**⁵⁷** Their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers; they were turned to one side like a twisted bow.

**⁵⁸** They made him angry with their high places; moving him to wrath with their images.

**⁵⁹** When this came to God's ears he was very angry, and gave up Israel completely;

**⁶⁰** So that he went away from the holy place in Shiloh, the tent which he had put among men;

**⁶¹** And he let his strength be taken prisoner, and gave his glory into the hands of his hater.

**⁶²** He gave his people up to the sword, and was angry with his heritage.

**⁶³** Their young men were burned in the fire; and their virgins were not praised in the bride-song.

**⁶⁴** Their priests were put to death by the sword, and their widows made no weeping for them.

**⁶⁵** Then was the Lord like one awaking from sleep, and like a strong man crying out because of wine.

**⁶⁶** His haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever.

**⁶⁷** And he put the tent of Joseph on one side, and took not the tribe of Ephraim;

**⁶⁸** But he took the tribe of Judah for himself, and the mountain of Zion, in which he had pleasure.

**⁶⁹** And he made his holy place like the high heaven, like the earth which is fixed by him for ever.

**⁷⁰** He took David to be his servant, taking him from the place of the flocks;

**⁷¹** From looking after the sheep which were giving milk, he took him to give food to Jacob his people, and to Israel his heritage.

**⁷²** So he gave them food with an upright heart, guiding them by the wisdom of his hands.
