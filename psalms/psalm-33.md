# Psalm 33

<sup>1</sup> Be glad in the Lord, O doers of righteousness; for praise is beautiful for the upright. 

<sup>2</sup> Give praise to the Lord on the corded instrument; make melody to him with instruments of music. 

<sup>3</sup> Make a new song to him; playing expertly with a loud noise. 

<sup>4</sup> For the word of the Lord is upright, and all his works are certain. 

<sup>5</sup> His delight is in righteousness and wisdom; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the army of heaven by the breath of his mouth. 

<sup>7</sup> He makes the waters of the sea come together in a mass; he keeps the deep seas in store-houses. 

<sup>8</sup> Let the earth be full of the fear of the Lord; let all the people of the world be in holy fear of him. 

<sup>9</sup> For he gave the word, and it was done; by his order it was fixed for ever. 

<sup>10</sup> The Lord undoes the designs of the nations; he makes the thoughts of the peoples without effect. 

<sup>11</sup> The Lord's purpose is eternal, the designs of his heart go on through all the generations of man. 

<sup>12</sup> Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he has taken for his heritage. 

<sup>13</sup> The Lord is looking down from heaven; he sees all the sons of men; 

<sup>14</sup> From his house he keeps watch on all who are living on the earth; 

<sup>15</sup> He makes all their hearts; their works are clear to him. 

<sup>16</sup> A king's salvation is not in the power of his army; a strong man does not get free by his great strength. 

<sup>17</sup> A horse is a false hope; his great power will not make any man free from danger. 

<sup>18</sup> See, the eye of the Lord is on those in whose hearts is the fear of him, on those whose hope is in his mercy; 

<sup>19</sup> To keep their souls from death; and to keep them living in time of need. 

<sup>20</sup> Our souls are waiting for the Lord; he is our help and our salvation. 

<sup>21</sup> For in him our hearts have joy; in his holy name is our hope. 

<sup>22</sup> Let your mercy be on us, O Lord, as we are waiting for you.
