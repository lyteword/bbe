# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> And Job made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> If only my passion might be measured, and put into the scales against my trouble! 

<sup>3</sup> For then its weight would be more than the sand of the seas: because of this my words have been uncontrolled. 

<sup>4</sup> For the arrows of the Ruler of all are present with me, and their poison goes deep into my spirit: his army of fears is put in order against me. 

<sup>5</sup> Does the ass of the fields give out his voice when he has grass? or does the ox make sounds over his food? 

<sup>6</sup> Will a man take food which has no taste without salt? or is there any taste in the soft substance of purslain? 

<sup>7</sup> My soul has no desire for such things, they are as disease in my food. 

<sup>8</sup> If only I might have an answer to my prayer, and God would give me my desire! 

<sup>9</sup> If only he would be pleased to put an end to me; and would let loose his hand, so that I might be cut off! 

<sup>10</sup> So I would still have comfort, and I would have joy in the pains of death, for I have not been false to the words of the Holy One. 

<sup>11</sup> Have I strength to go on waiting, or have I any end to be looking forward to? 

<sup>12</sup> Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh brass? 

<sup>13</sup> I have no help in myself, and wisdom is completely gone from me. 

<sup>14</sup> He whose heart is shut against his friend has given up the fear of the Ruler of all. 

<sup>15</sup> My friends have been false like a stream, like streams in the valleys which come to an end: 

<sup>16</sup> Which are dark because of the ice, and the snow falling into them; 

<sup>17</sup> Under the burning sun they are cut off, and come to nothing because of the heat. 

<sup>18</sup> The camel-trains go out of their way; they go up into the waste and come to destruction. 

<sup>19</sup> The camel-trains of Tema were searching with care, the bands of Sheba were waiting for them: 

<sup>20</sup> They were put to shame because of their hope; they came and their hope was gone. 

<sup>21</sup> So have you now become to me; you see my sad condition and are in fear. 

<sup>22</sup> Did I say, Give me something? or, Make a payment for me out of your wealth? 

<sup>23</sup> Or, Get me out of the power of my hater? or, Give money so that I may be free from the power of the cruel ones? 

<sup>24</sup> Give me teaching and I will be quiet; and make me see my error. 

<sup>25</sup> How pleasing are upright words! but what force is there in your arguments? 

<sup>26</sup> My words may seem wrong to you, but the words of him who has no hope are for the wind. 

<sup>27</sup> Truly, you are such as would give up the child of a dead man to his creditors, and would make a profit out of your friend. 

<sup>28</sup> Now then, let your eyes be turned to me, for truly I will not say what is false to your face. 

<sup>29</sup> Let your minds be changed, and do not have an evil opinion of me; yes, be changed, for my righteousness is still in me. 

<sup>30</sup> Is there evil in my tongue? is not the cause of my trouble clear to me?
