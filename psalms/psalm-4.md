# Psalm 4

To the chief music-maker on corded instruments. A Psalm. Of David.

<sup>1</sup> Give answer to my cry, O God of my righteousness; make me free from my troubles; have mercy on me, and give ear to my prayer.

<sup>2</sup> O you sons of men, how long will you go on turning my glory into shame? how long will you give your love to foolish things, going after what is false? (Selah.)

<sup>3</sup> See how the Lord has made great his mercy for me; the Lord will give ear to my cry.

<sup>4</sup> Let there be fear in your hearts, and do no sin; have bitter feelings on your bed, but make no sound. (Selah.)

<sup>5</sup> Give the offerings of righteousness, and put your faith in the Lord.

<sup>6</sup> There are numbers who say, Who will do us any good? the light of his face has gone from us.

<sup>7</sup> Lord, you have put joy in my heart, more than they have when their grain and their wine are increased.

<sup>8</sup> I will take my rest on my bed in peace, because you only, Lord, keep me safe.
