# Job 8 

**¹** Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,

**²** How long will you say these things, and how long will the words of your mouth be like a strong wind?

**³** Does God give wrong decisions? or is the Ruler of all not upright in his judging?

**⁴** If your children have done evil against him, then their punishment is from his hand.

**⁵** If you will make search for God with care, and put your request before the Ruler of all;

**⁶** If you are clean and upright; then he will certainly be moved to take up your cause, and will make clear your righteousness by building up your house again.

**⁷** And though your start was small, your end will be very great.

**⁸** Put the question now to the past generations, and give attention to what has been searched out by their fathers:

**⁹** (For we are but of yesterday, and have no knowledge, because our days on earth are gone like a shade:)

**¹⁰** Will they not give you teaching, and say words of wisdom to you?

**¹¹** Will the river-plant come up in its pride without wet earth? will the grass get tall without water?

**¹²** When it is still green, without being cut down, it becomes dry and dead before any other plant.

**¹³** So is the end of all who do not keep God in mind; and the hope of the evil-doer comes to nothing:

**¹⁴** Whose support is cut off, and whose hope is no stronger than a spider's thread.

**¹⁵** He is looking to his family for support, but it is not there; he puts his hope in it, but it comes to nothing.

**¹⁶** He is full of strength before the sun, and his branches go out over his garden.

**¹⁷** His roots are twisted round the stones, forcing their way in between them.

**¹⁸** If he is taken away from his place, then it will say, I have not seen you.

**¹⁹** Such is the joy of his way, and out of the dust another comes up to take his place.

**²⁰** Truly, God will not give up him who is without sin, and will not take evil-doers by the hand.

**²¹** The time will come when your mouth will be full of laughing, and cries of joy will come from your lips.

**²²** Your haters will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the sinner will not be seen again.
