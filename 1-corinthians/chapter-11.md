# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> So take me for your example, even as I take Christ for mine. 

<sup>2</sup> Now I am pleased to see that you keep me in memory in all things, and that you give attention to the teaching which was handed down from me to you. 

<sup>3</sup> But it is important for you to keep this fact in mind, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. 

<sup>4</sup> Every man who takes part in prayer, or gives teaching as a prophet, with his head covered, puts shame on his head. 

<sup>5</sup> But every woman who does so with her head unveiled, puts shame on her head: for it is the same as if her hair was cut off. 

<sup>6</sup> For if a woman is not veiled, let her hair be cut off; but if it is a shame to a woman to have her hair cut off, let her be veiled. 

<sup>7</sup> For it is not right for a man to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 

<sup>8</sup> For the man did not come from the woman, but the woman from the man. 

<sup>9</sup> And the man was not made for the woman, but the woman for the man. 

<sup>10</sup> For this reason it is right for the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. 

<sup>11</sup> But the woman is not separate from the man, and the man is not separate from the woman in the Lord. 

<sup>12</sup> For as the woman is from the man, so the man is through the woman; but all things are from God. 

<sup>13</sup> Be judges yourselves of the question: does it seem right for a woman to take part in prayer unveiled? 

<sup>14</sup> Does it not seem natural to you that if a man has long hair, it is a cause of shame to him? 

<sup>15</sup> But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given to her for a covering. 

<sup>16</sup> But if any man will not be ruled in this question, this is not our way of doing things, and it is not done in the churches of God. 

<sup>17</sup> But in giving you this order, there is one thing about which I am not pleased: it is that when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. 

<sup>18</sup> For first of all, it has come to my ears that when you come together in the church, there are divisions among you, and I take the statement to be true in part. 

<sup>19</sup> For divisions are necessary among you, in order that those who have God's approval may be clearly seen among you. 

<sup>20</sup> But now, when you come together, it is not possible to take the holy meal of the Lord: 

<sup>21</sup> For when you take your food, everyone takes his meal before the other; and one has not enough food, and another is the worse for drink. 

<sup>22</sup> What? have you not houses to take your meals in? or have you no respect for the church of God, putting the poor to shame? What am I to say to you? am I to give you praise? certainly not. 

<sup>23</sup> For it was handed down to me from the Lord, as I gave it to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when Judas was false to him, took bread, 

<sup>24</sup> And when it had been broken with an act of praise, he said, This is my body which is for you: do this in memory of me. 

<sup>25</sup> In the same way, with the cup, after the meal, he said, This cup is the new testament in my blood: do this, whenever you take it, in memory of me. 

<sup>26</sup> For whenever you take the bread and the cup you give witness to the Lord's death till he comes. 

<sup>27</sup> If, then, anyone takes the bread or the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit, he will be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord. 

<sup>28</sup> But let no man take of the bread and the cup without testing himself. 

<sup>29</sup> For a man puts himself in danger, if he takes part in the holy meal without being conscious that it is the Lord's body. 

<sup>30</sup> For this cause a number of you are feeble and ill, and a number are dead. 

<sup>31</sup> But if we were true judges of ourselves, punishment would not come on us. 

<sup>32</sup> But if punishment does come, it is sent by the Lord, so that we may be safe when the world is judged. 

<sup>33</sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to the holy meal of the Lord, let there be waiting for one another. 

<sup>34</sup> If any man is in need of food, let him take his meal in his house; so that you may not come together to your damage. And the rest I will put in order when I come.
