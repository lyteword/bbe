# Psalm 127

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. Of Solomon. If the Lord is not helping the builders, then the building of a house is to no purpose: if the Lord does not keep the town, the watchman keeps his watch for nothing. 

<sup>2</sup> It is of no use for you to get up early, and to go late to your rest, with the bread of sorrow for your food; for the Lord gives to his loved ones in sleep. 

<sup>3</sup> See, sons are a heritage from the Lord; the fruit of the body is his reward. 

<sup>4</sup> Like arrows in the hand of a man of war, are the children of the young. 

<sup>5</sup> Happy is the man who has a good store of them; he will not be put to shame, but his cause will be supported by them against his haters.
