# Psalm 114

<sup>1</sup> When Israel came out of Egypt, the children of Jacob from a people whose language was strange to them; 

<sup>2</sup> Judah became his holy place, and Israel his kingdom. 

<sup>3</sup> The sea saw it, and went in flight; Jordan was turned back. 

<sup>4</sup> The mountains were jumping like goats, and the little hills like lambs. 

<sup>5</sup> What was wrong with you, O sea, that you went in flight? O Jordan, that you were turned back? 

<sup>6</sup> You mountains, why were you jumping like goats, and you little hills like lambs? 

<sup>7</sup> Be troubled, O earth, before the Lord, before the God of Jacob; 

<sup>8</sup> Who made the rock into a water-spring, and the hard stone into a fountain.
