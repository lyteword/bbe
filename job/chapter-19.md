# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> And Job made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> How long will you make my life bitter, crushing me with words? 

<sup>3</sup> Ten times now you have made sport of me; it gives you no sense of shame to do me wrong. 

<sup>4</sup> And, truly, if I have been in error, the effect of my error is only on myself. 

<sup>5</sup> If you make yourselves great against me, using my punishment as an argument against me, 

<sup>6</sup> Be certain that it is God who has done me wrong, and has taken me in his net. 

<sup>7</sup> Truly, I make an outcry against the violent man, but there is no answer: I give a cry for help, but no one takes up my cause. 

<sup>8</sup> My way is walled up by him so that I may not go by: he has made my roads dark. 

<sup>9</sup> He has put off my glory from me, and taken the crown from my head. 

<sup>10</sup> I am broken down by him on every side, and I am gone; my hope is uprooted like a tree. 

<sup>11</sup> His wrath is burning against me, and I am to him as one of his haters. 

<sup>12</sup> His armies come on together, they make their road high against me, and put up their tents round mine. 

<sup>13</sup> He has taken my brothers far away from me; they have seen my fate and have become strange to me. 

<sup>14</sup> My relations and my near friends have given me up, and those living in my house have put me out of their minds. 

<sup>15</sup> I am strange to my women-servants, and seem to them as one from another country. 

<sup>16</sup> At my cry my servant gives me no answer, and I have to make a prayer to him. 

<sup>17</sup> My breath is strange to my wife, and I am disgusting to the offspring of my mother's body. 

<sup>18</sup> Even young children have no respect for me; when I get up their backs are turned on me. 

<sup>19</sup> All the men of my circle keep away from me; and those dear to me are turned against me. 

<sup>20</sup> My bones are joined to my skin, and I have got away with my flesh in my teeth. 

<sup>21</sup> Have pity on me, have pity on me, O my friends! for the hand of God is on me. 

<sup>22</sup> Why are you cruel to me, like God, for ever saying evil against me? 

<sup>23</sup> If only my words might be recorded! if they might be put in writing in a book! 

<sup>24</sup> And with an iron pen and lead be cut into the rock for ever! 

<sup>25</sup> But I am certain that he who will take up my cause is living, and that in time to come he will take his place on the dust; 

<sup>26</sup> And ... without my flesh I will see God; 

<sup>27</sup> Whom I will see on my side, and not as one strange to me. My heart is broken with desire. 

<sup>28</sup> If you say, How cruel we will be to him! because the root of sin is clearly in him: 

<sup>29</sup> Be in fear of the sword, for the sword is the punishment for such things, so that you may be certain that there is a judge.
