# Psalm 144

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Of David. Praise be to the God of my strength, teaching my hands the use of the sword, and my fingers the art of fighting: 

<sup>2</sup> He is my strength, and my Rock; my high tower, and my saviour; my keeper and my hope: he gives me authority over my people. 

<sup>3</sup> Lord, what is man, that you keep him in mind? or the son of man that you take him into account? 

<sup>4</sup> Man is like a breath: his life is like a shade which is quickly gone. 

<sup>5</sup> Come down, O Lord, from your heavens: at your touch let the mountains give out smoke. 

<sup>6</sup> With your storm-flames send them in flight: send out your arrows for their destruction. 

<sup>7</sup> Put out your hand from on high; make me free, take me safely out of the great waters, and out of the hands of strange men; 

<sup>8</sup> In whose mouths are false words, and whose right hand is a right hand of deceit. 

<sup>9</sup> I will make a new song to you, O God; I will make melody to you on an instrument of ten cords. 

<sup>10</sup> It is God who gives salvation to kings; and who kept his servant David from the wounding sword. 

<sup>11</sup> Make me free, and take me out of the hands of strange men, in whose mouths are false words, and whose right hand is a right hand of deceit. 

<sup>12</sup> Our sons are like tall young plants; and our daughters like the shining stones of a king's house; 

<sup>13</sup> Our store-houses are full of all good things; and our sheep give birth to thousands and ten thousands in our fields. 

<sup>14</sup> Our oxen are well weighted down; our cows give birth safely; there is no going out, and there is no cry of sorrow in our open places. 

<sup>15</sup> Happy is the nation whose ways are so ordered: yes, happy is the nation whose God is the Lord.
