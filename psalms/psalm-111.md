# Psalm 111 

**¹** Let the Lord be praised. I will give praise to the Lord with all my heart, among the upright, and in the meeting of the people.

**²** The works of the Lord are great, searched out by all those who have delight in them.

**³** His work is full of honour and glory; and his righteousness is unchanging for ever.

**⁴** Certain for ever is the memory of his wonders: the Lord is full of pity and mercy.

**⁵** He has given food to his worshippers; he will keep his agreement in mind for ever.

**⁶** He has made clear to his people the power of his works, giving them the heritage of the nations.

**⁷** The works of his hands are faith and righteousness; all his laws are unchanging.

**⁸** They are fixed for ever and ever, they are done in faith and righteousness.

**⁹** He has sent salvation to his people; he has given his word for ever: holy is his name and greatly to be feared.

**¹⁰** The fear of the Lord is the best part of wisdom: all those who keep his laws are wise: his praise is eternal.
