# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> Better a bit of dry bread in peace, than a house full of feasting and violent behaviour. 

<sup>2</sup> A servant who does wisely will have rule over a son causing shame, and will have his part in the heritage among brothers. 

<sup>3</sup> The heating-pot is for silver and the oven-fire for gold, but the Lord is the tester of hearts. 

<sup>4</sup> A wrongdoer gives attention to evil lips, and a man of deceit gives ear to a damaging tongue. 

<sup>5</sup> Whoever makes sport of the poor puts shame on his Maker; and he who is glad because of trouble will not go free from punishment. 

<sup>6</sup> Children's children are the crown of old men, and the glory of children is their fathers. 

<sup>7</sup> Fair words are not to be looked for from a foolish man, much less are false lips in a ruler. 

<sup>8</sup> An offering of money is like a stone of great price in the eyes of him who has it: wherever he goes, he does well. 

<sup>9</sup> He who keeps a sin covered is looking for love; but he who keeps on talking of a thing makes division between friends. 

<sup>10</sup> A word of protest goes deeper into one who has sense than a hundred blows into a foolish man. 

<sup>11</sup> An uncontrolled man is only looking for trouble, so a cruel servant will be sent against him. 

<sup>12</sup> It is better to come face to face with a bear whose young ones have been taken away than with a foolish man acting foolishly. 

<sup>13</sup> If anyone gives back evil for good, evil will never go away from his house. 

<sup>14</sup> The start of fighting is like the letting out of water: so give up before it comes to blows. 

<sup>15</sup> He who gives a decision for the evil-doer and he who gives a decision against the upright, are equally disgusting to the Lord. 

<sup>16</sup> How will money in the hand of the foolish get him wisdom, seeing that he has no sense? 

<sup>17</sup> A friend is loving at all times, and becomes a brother in times of trouble. 

<sup>18</sup> A man without sense gives his hand in an agreement, and makes himself responsible before his neighbour. 

<sup>19</sup> The lover of fighting is a lover of sin: he who makes high his doorway is looking for destruction. 

<sup>20</sup> Nothing good comes to him whose heart is fixed on evil purposes: and he who has an evil tongue will come to trouble. 

<sup>21</sup> He who has an unwise son gets sorrow for himself, and the father of a foolish son has no joy. 

<sup>22</sup> A glad heart makes a healthy body, but a crushed spirit makes the bones dry. 

<sup>23</sup> A sinner takes an offering out of his robe, to get a decision for himself in a cause. 

<sup>24</sup> Wisdom is before the face of him who has sense; but the eyes of the foolish are on the ends of the earth. 

<sup>25</sup> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitter pain to her who gave him birth. 

<sup>26</sup> To give punishment to the upright is not good, or to give blows to the noble for their righteousness. 

<sup>27</sup> He who has knowledge says little: and he who has a calm spirit is a man of good sense. 

<sup>28</sup> Even the foolish man, when he keeps quiet, is taken to be wise: when his lips are shut he is credited with good sense.
