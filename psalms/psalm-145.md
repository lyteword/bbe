# Psalm 145

<sup>1</sup> A Song of praise. Of David. Let me give glory to you, O God, my King; and blessing to your name for ever and ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Every day will I give you blessing, praising your name for ever and ever. 

<sup>3</sup> Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; his power may never be searched out. 

<sup>4</sup> One generation after another will give praise to your great acts, and make clear the operation of your strength. 

<sup>5</sup> My thoughts will be of the honour and glory of your rule, and of the wonder of your works. 

<sup>6</sup> Men will be talking of the power and fear of your acts; I will give word of your glory. 

<sup>7</sup> Their sayings will be full of the memory of all your mercy, and they will make songs of your righteousness. 

<sup>8</sup> The Lord is full of grace and pity; not quickly angry, but great in mercy. 

<sup>9</sup> The Lord is good to all men; and his mercies are over all his works. 

<sup>10</sup> All the works of your hands give praise to you, O Lord; and your saints give you blessing. 

<sup>11</sup> Their words will be of the glory of your kingdom, and their talk of your strength; 

<sup>12</sup> So that the sons of men may have knowledge of his acts of power, and of the great glory of his kingdom. 

<sup>13</sup> Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and your rule is through all generations. 

<sup>14</sup> The Lord is the support of all who are crushed, and the lifter up of all who are bent down. 

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of all men are waiting for you; and you give them their food in its time. 

<sup>16</sup> By the opening of your hand, every living thing has its desire in full measure. 

<sup>17</sup> The Lord is upright in all his ways, and kind in all his works. 

<sup>18</sup> The Lord is near all those who give honour to his name; even to all who give honour to him with true hearts. 

<sup>19</sup> To his worshippers, he will give their desire; their cry comes to his ears, and he gives them salvation. 

<sup>20</sup> The Lord will keep all his worshippers from danger; but he will send destruction on all sinners. 

<sup>21</sup> My mouth will give praise to the Lord; let all flesh be blessing his holy name for ever and ever.
