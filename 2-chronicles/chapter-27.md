# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years; and his mother's name was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 

<sup>2</sup> He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Uzziah had done; but he did not go into the Temple of the Lord. And the people still went on in their evil ways. 

<sup>3</sup> He put up the higher doorway of the house of the Lord, and did much building on the wall of the Ophel. 

<sup>4</sup> In addition, he made towns in the hill-country of Judah, and strong buildings and towers in the woodlands. 

<sup>5</sup> He went to war with the king of the children of Ammon and overcame them. That year, the children of Ammon gave him a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of grain and ten thousand measures of barley. And the children of Ammon gave him the same amount the second year and the third. 

<sup>6</sup> So Jotham became strong, because in all his ways he made the Lord his guide. 

<sup>7</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 

<sup>8</sup> He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years. 

<sup>9</sup> And Jotham went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the earth in the town of David; and Ahaz his son became king in his place.
