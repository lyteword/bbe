# Psalm 60

To the chief music-maker; put to Shushan-eduth. Michtam. Of David. For teaching. When he was fighting against Aram-naharaim and Aramzobah, when Joab came back, and put twelve thousand of the Edomites to death, in the Valley of Salt.

<sup>1</sup> God, you have put us away from you, you have sent us in all directions, you have been angry; O be turned to us again.

<sup>2</sup> By the power of your hand the earth is shaking and broken; make it strong again, for it is moved.

<sup>3</sup> You have made the people see hard times; you have given us the wine of shaking for our drink.

<sup>4</sup> Give a safe place to those who have fear of you, where they may go in flight from before the bow. (Selah.)

<sup>5</sup> So that your loved ones may be made safe, let your right hand be my salvation, and give me an answer.

<sup>6</sup> God has said in his holy place, I will be glad: I will make a division of Shechem, and the valley of Succoth will be measured out.

<sup>7</sup> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; and Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;

<sup>8</sup> Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I put out my shoe; over Philistia will a glad cry be sounded.

<sup>9</sup> Who will take me into the strong town? who will be my guide into Edom?

<sup>10</sup> Have not you put us away, O God? and you have not gone out with our armies.

<sup>11</sup> Give us help in our trouble; for there is no help in man.

<sup>12</sup> Through God we will do great things, for through him our haters will be crushed under our feet.
