# Psalm 90

A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.

**¹** Lord, you have been our resting-place in all generations.

**²** Before the mountains were made, before you had given birth to the earth and the world, before time was, and for ever, you are God.

**³** You send man back to his dust; and say, Go back, you children of men.

**⁴** For to you a thousand years are no more than yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night.

**⁵** ...

**⁶** In the morning it is green; in the evening it is cut down, and becomes dry.

**⁷** We are burned up by the heat of your passion, and troubled by your wrath.

**⁸** You have put our evil doings before you, our secret sins in the light of your face.

**⁹** For all our days have gone by in your wrath; our years come to an end like a breath.

**¹⁰** The measure of our life is seventy years; and if through strength it may be eighty years, its pride is only trouble and sorrow, for it comes to an end and we are quickly gone.

**¹¹** Who has knowledge of the power of your wrath, or who takes note of the weight of your passion?

**¹²** So give us knowledge of the number of our days, that we may get a heart of wisdom.

**¹³** Come back, O Lord; how long? let your purpose for your servants be changed.

**¹⁴** In the morning give us your mercy in full measure; so that we may have joy and delight all our days.

**¹⁵** Make us glad in reward for the days of our sorrow, and for the years in which we have seen evil.

**¹⁶** Make your work clear to your servants, and your glory to their children.

**¹⁷** Let the pleasure of the Lord our God be on us: O Lord, give strength to the work of our hands.
