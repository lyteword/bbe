# Psalm 120

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. In my trouble my cry went up to the Lord, and he gave me an answer. 

<sup>2</sup> O Lord, be the saviour of my soul from false lips, and from the tongue of deceit. 

<sup>3</sup> What punishment will he give you? what more will he do to you, you false tongue? 

<sup>4</sup> Sharp arrows of the strong, and burning fire. 

<sup>5</sup> Sorrow is mine because I am strange in Meshech, and living in the tents of Kedar. 

<sup>6</sup> My soul has long been living with the haters of peace. 

<sup>7</sup> I am for peace: but when I say so, they are for war.
