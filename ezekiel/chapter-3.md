# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> And he said to me, Son of man, take this roll for your food, and go and say my words to the children of Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> And, on my opening my mouth, he made me take the roll as food. 

<sup>3</sup> And he said to me, Son of man, let your stomach make a meal of it and let your inside be full of this roll which I am giving you. Then I took it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth. 

<sup>4</sup> And he said to me, Son of man, go now to the children of Israel, and say my words to them. 

<sup>5</sup> For you are not sent to a people whose talk is strange and whose language is hard, but to the children of Israel; 

<sup>6</sup> Not to a number of peoples whose talk is strange and whose language is hard and whose words are not clear to you. Truly, if I sent you to them they would give ear to you. 

<sup>7</sup> But the children of Israel will not give ear to you; for they have no mind to give ear to me: for all the children of Israel have a hard brow and a stiff heart. 

<sup>8</sup> See, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your brow hard against their brows. 

<sup>9</sup> Like a diamond harder than rock I have made your brow: have no fear of them and do not be overcome by their looks, for they are an uncontrolled people. 

<sup>10</sup> Then he said to me, Son of man, take into your heart all my words which I am about to say to you, and let your ears be open to them. 

<sup>11</sup> And go now to those who have been taken away as prisoners, to the children of your people, and say to them, This is what the Lord has said; if they give ear or if they do not. 

<sup>12</sup> Then I was lifted up by the wind, and at my back the sound of a great rushing came to my ears when the glory of the Lord was lifted up from his place. 

<sup>13</sup> And there was the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another, and the sound of the wheels at their side, the sound of a great rushing. 

<sup>14</sup> And the wind, lifting me up, took me away: and I went in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of the Lord was strong on me. 

<sup>15</sup> Then I came to those who had been taken away as prisoners, who were at Telabib by the river Chebar, and I was seated among them full of wonder for seven days. 

<sup>16</sup> And at the end of seven days, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

<sup>17</sup> Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the children of Israel: so give ear to the word of my mouth, and give them word from me of their danger. 

<sup>18</sup> When I say to the evil-doer, Death will certainly be your fate; and you give him no word of it and say nothing to make clear to the evil-doer the danger of his evil way, so that he may be safe; that same evil man will come to death in his evil-doing; but I will make you responsible for his blood. 

<sup>19</sup> But if you give the evil-doer word of his danger, and he is not turned from his sin or from his evil way, death will overtake him in his evil-doing; but your life will be safe. 

<sup>20</sup> Again, when an upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, and I put a cause of falling in his way, death will overtake him: because you have given him no word of his danger, death will overtake him in his evil-doing, and there will be no memory of the upright acts which he has done; but I will make you responsible for his blood. 

<sup>21</sup> But if you say to the upright man that he is not to do evil, he will certainly keep his life because he took note of your word; and your life will be safe. 

<sup>22</sup> And the hand of the Lord was on me there; and he said, Get up and go out into the valley and there I will have talk with you. 

<sup>23</sup> Then I got up and went out into the valley; and I saw the glory of the Lord resting there as I had seen it by the river Chebar; and I went down on my face. 

<sup>24</sup> Then the spirit came into me and put me on my feet; and he had talk with me and said to me, Go and keep yourself shut up inside your house. 

<sup>25</sup> But see, O son of man, I will put bands on you, prisoning you in them, and you will not go out among them: 

<sup>26</sup> And I will make your tongue fixed to the roof of your mouth, so that you have no voice and may not make protests to them: for they are an uncontrolled people. 

<sup>27</sup> But when I have talk with you I will make your mouth open, and you are to say to them, This is what the Lord has said: Let the hearer give ear; and as for him who will not, let him keep his ears shut: for they are an uncontrolled people.
