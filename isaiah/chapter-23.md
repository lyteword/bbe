# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> The word about Tyre. Let a cry of sorrow go up, O ships of Tarshish, because your strong place is made waste; on the way back from the land of Kittim the news is given to them. 

<sup>2</sup> Send out a cry of grief, you men of the sea-land, traders of Zidon, who go over the sea, whose representatives are on great waters; 

<sup>3</sup> Who get in the seed of Shihor, whose wealth is the trade of the nations. 

<sup>4</sup> Be shamed, O Zidon: for the sea, the strong place of the sea has said, I have not been with child, or given birth; I have not taken care of young men, or kept watch over the growth of virgins. 

<sup>5</sup> When the news comes to Egypt they will be bitterly pained at the fate of Tyre. 

<sup>6</sup> Go over to Tarshish; give cries of sorrow, O men of the sea-land. 

<sup>7</sup> Is this the town which was full of joy, whose start goes back to times long past, whose wanderings took her into far-off countries? 

<sup>8</sup> By whom was this purposed against Tyre, the crowning town, whose traders are chiefs, whose business men are honoured in the land? 

<sup>9</sup> It was the purpose of the Lord of armies to put pride to shame, to make sport of the glory of those who are honoured in the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Let your land be worked with the plough, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no longer any harbour. 

<sup>11</sup> His hand is stretched out over the sea, the kingdoms are shaking: the Lord has given orders about Canaan, to make waste its strong places. 

<sup>12</sup> And he said, There is no more joy for you, O crushed virgin daughter of Zidon: up! go over to Kittim; even there you will have no rest. 

<sup>13</sup> ... 

<sup>14</sup> Let a cry of sorrow go up, O ships of Tarshish: because your strong place is made waste. 

<sup>15</sup> And it will be in that day that Tyre will go out of mind for seventy years, that is, the days of one king: after the end of seventy years it will be for Tyre as in the song of the loose woman. 

<sup>16</sup> Take an instrument of music, go about the town, O loose woman who has gone out from the memory of man; make sweet melody with songs, so that you may come back to men's minds. 

<sup>17</sup> And it will be after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will have mercy on Tyre, and she will go back to her trade, acting as a loose woman with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. 

<sup>18</sup> And her goods and her trade will be holy to the Lord: they will not be kept back or stored up; for her produce will be for those living in the Lord's land, to give them food for their needs, and fair clothing.
