# Psalm 51

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David. When Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Have pity on me, O God, in your mercy; out of a full heart, take away my sin. 

<sup>2</sup> Let all my wrongdoing be washed away, and make me clean from evil. 

<sup>3</sup> For I am conscious of my error; my sin is ever before me. 

<sup>4</sup> Against you, you only, have I done wrong, working that which is evil in your eyes; so that your words may be seen to be right, and you may be clear when you are judging. 

<sup>5</sup> Truly, I was formed in evil, and in sin did my mother give me birth. 

<sup>6</sup> Your desire is for what is true in the inner parts: in the secrets of my soul you will give me knowledge of wisdom. 

<sup>7</sup> Make me free from sin with hyssop: let me be washed whiter than snow. 

<sup>8</sup> Make me full of joy and rapture; so that the bones which have been broken may be glad. 

<sup>9</sup> Let your face be turned from my wrongdoing, and take away all my sins. 

<sup>10</sup> Make a clean heart in me, O God; give me a right spirit again. 

<sup>11</sup> Do not put me away from before you, or take your holy spirit from me. 

<sup>12</sup> Give me back the joy of your salvation; let a free spirit be my support. 

<sup>13</sup> Then will I make your ways clear to wrongdoers; and sinners will be turned to you. 

<sup>14</sup> Be my saviour from violent death, O God, the God of my salvation; and my tongue will give praise to your righteousness. 

<sup>15</sup> O Lord, let my lips be open, so that my mouth may make clear your praise. 

<sup>16</sup> You have no desire for an offering or I would give it; you have no delight in burned offerings. 

<sup>17</sup> The offerings of God are a broken spirit; a broken and sorrowing heart, O God, you will not put from you. 

<sup>18</sup> Do good to Zion in your good pleasure, building up the walls of Jerusalem. 

<sup>19</sup> Then you will have delight in the offerings of righteousness, in burned offerings and offerings of beasts; then they will make offerings of oxen on your altar.
