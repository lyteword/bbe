# Proverbs 28 

**¹** The evil man goes running away when no man is after him, but the upright are without fear, like the lion.

**²** Because of the sin of the land, its troubles are increased; but by a man of wisdom and knowledge they will be put out like a fire.

**³** A man of wealth who is cruel to the poor is like a violent rain causing destruction of food.

**⁴** Those who have no respect for the law give praise to the evil-doer; but such as keep the law are against him.

**⁵** Evil men have no knowledge of what is right; but those who go after the Lord have knowledge of all things.

**⁶** Better is the poor man whose ways are upright, than the man of wealth whose ways are not straight.

**⁷** He who keeps the law is a wise son, but he who keeps company with feasters puts shame on his father.

**⁸** He who makes his wealth greater by taking interest, only gets it together for him who has pity on the poor.

**⁹** As for the man whose ear is turned away from hearing the law, even his prayer is disgusting.

**¹⁰** Anyone causing the upright to go wandering in an evil way, will himself go down into the hole he has made; but the upright will have good things for their heritage.

**¹¹** The man of wealth seems to himself to be wise, but the poor man who has sense has a low opinion of him.

**¹²** When the upright do well, there is great glory; but when evil-doers are lifted up, men do not let themselves be seen.

**¹³** He who keeps his sins secret will not do well; but one who is open about them, and gives them up, will get mercy.

**¹⁴** Happy is the man in whom is the fear of the Lord at all times; but he whose heart is hard will come into trouble.

**¹⁵** Like a loud-voiced lion and a wandering bear, is an evil ruler over a poor people.

**¹⁶** The prince who has no sense is a cruel ruler; but he who has no desire to get profit for himself will have long life.

**¹⁷** One who has been the cause of a man's death will go in flight to the underworld: let no man give him help.

**¹⁸** He whose ways are upright will be safe, but sudden will be the fall of him whose ways are twisted.

**¹⁹** By ploughing his land a man will have bread in full measure; but he who goes after good-for-nothing persons will be poor enough.

**²⁰** A man of good faith will have great blessing, but one attempting to get wealth quickly will not go free from punishment.

**²¹** It is not good to have respect for a man's position: for a man will do wrong for a bit of bread.

**²²** He who is ever desiring wealth goes running after money, and does not see that need will come on him.

**²³** He who says words of protest to a man will later have more approval than one who says smooth words with his tongue.

**²⁴** He who takes from his father or his mother what is theirs by right, and says, It is no sin; is the same as a taker of life.

**²⁵** He who is ever desiring profit is a cause of fighting; but he who puts his faith in the Lord will be made fat.

**²⁶** He whose faith is in himself is foolish; but everyone walking wisely will be kept safe.

**²⁷** He who gives to the poor will never be in need, but great curses will be on him who gives no attention to them.

**²⁸** When evil-doers are lifted up, men take cover; but when destruction overtakes them, the upright are increased.
