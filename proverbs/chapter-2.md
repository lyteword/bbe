# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> My son, if you will take my words to your heart, storing up my laws in your mind; 

<sup>2</sup> So that your ear gives attention to wisdom, and your heart is turned to knowledge; 

<sup>3</sup> Truly, if you are crying out for good sense, and your request is for knowledge; 

<sup>4</sup> If you are looking for her as for silver, and searching for her as for stored-up wealth; 

<sup>5</sup> Then the fear of the Lord will be clear to you, and knowledge of God will be yours. 

<sup>6</sup> For the Lord gives wisdom; out of his mouth come knowledge and reason: 

<sup>7</sup> He has salvation stored up for the upright, he is a breastplate to those in whom there is no evil; 

<sup>8</sup> He keeps watch on the ways which are right, and takes care of those who have the fear of him. 

<sup>9</sup> Then you will have knowledge of righteousness and right acting, and upright behaviour, even of every good way. 

<sup>10</sup> For wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul; 

<sup>11</sup> Wise purposes will be watching over you, and knowledge will keep you; 

<sup>12</sup> Giving you salvation from the evil man, from those whose words are false; 

<sup>13</sup> Who give up the way of righteousness, to go by dark roads; 

<sup>14</sup> Who take pleasure in wrongdoing, and have joy in the evil designs of the sinner; 

<sup>15</sup> Whose ways are not straight, and whose footsteps are turned to evil: 

<sup>16</sup> To take you out of the power of the strange woman, who says smooth words with her tongue; 

<sup>17</sup> Who is false to the husband of her early years, and does not keep the agreement of her God in mind: 

<sup>18</sup> For her house is on the way down to death; her footsteps go down to the shades: 

<sup>19</sup> Those who go to her do not come back again; their feet do not keep in the ways of life: 

<sup>20</sup> So that you may go in the way of good men, and keep in the footsteps of the upright. 

<sup>21</sup> For the upright will be living in the land, and the good will have it for their heritage. 

<sup>22</sup> But sinners will be cut off from the land, and those whose acts are false will be uprooted.
