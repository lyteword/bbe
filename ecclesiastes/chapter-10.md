# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Dead flies make the oil of the perfumer give out an evil smell; more valued is a little wisdom than the great glory of the foolish. 

<sup>2</sup> The heart of the wise man goes in the right direction; but the heart of a foolish man in the wrong. 

<sup>3</sup> And when the foolish man is walking in the way, he has no sense and lets everyone see that he is foolish. 

<sup>4</sup> If the wrath of the ruler is against you, keep in your place; in him who keeps quiet even great sins may be overlooked. 

<sup>5</sup> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which comes by chance from a ruler: 

<sup>6</sup> The foolish are placed in high positions, but men of wealth are kept low. 

<sup>7</sup> I have seen servants on horses, and rulers walking on the earth as servants. 

<sup>8</sup> He who makes a hole for others will himself go into it, and for him who makes a hole through a wall the bite of a snake will be a punishment. 

<sup>9</sup> He who gets out stones from the earth will be damaged by them, and in the cutting of wood there is danger. 

<sup>10</sup> If the iron has no edge, and he does not make it sharp, then he has to put out more strength; but wisdom makes things go well. 

<sup>11</sup> If a snake gives a bite before the word of power is said, then there is no longer any use in the word of power. 

<sup>12</sup> The words of a wise man's mouth are sweet to all, but the lips of a foolish man are his destruction. 

<sup>13</sup> The first words of his mouth are foolish, and the end of his talk is evil crime. 

<sup>14</sup> The foolish are full of words; man has no knowledge of what will be; and who is able to say what will be after him? 

<sup>15</sup> The work of the foolish will be a weariness to him, because he has no knowledge of the way to the town. 

<sup>16</sup> Unhappy is the land whose king is a boy, and whose rulers are feasting in the morning. 

<sup>17</sup> Happy is the land whose ruler is of noble birth, and whose chiefs take food at the right time, for strength and not for feasting. 

<sup>18</sup> When no work is done the roof goes in, and when the hands do nothing water comes into the house. 

<sup>19</sup> A feast is for laughing, and wine makes glad the heart; but by the one and the other money is wasted. 

<sup>20</sup> Say not a curse against the king, even in your thoughts; and even secretly say not a curse against the man of wealth; because a bird of the air will take the voice, and that which has wings will give news of it.
