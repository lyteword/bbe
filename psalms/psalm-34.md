# Psalm 34

Of David. When he made a change in his behaviour before Abimelech, who sent him away, and he went.

**¹** I will be blessing the Lord at all times; his praise will be ever in my mouth.

**²** My soul will say great things of the Lord: the poor in spirit will have knowledge of it and be glad.

**³** O give praise to the Lord with me; let us be witnesses together of his great name.

**⁴** I was searching for the Lord, and he gave ear to my voice, and made me free from all my fears.

**⁵** Let your eyes be turned to him and you will have light, and your faces will not be shamed.

**⁶** This poor man's cry came before the Lord, and he gave him salvation from all his troubles.

**⁷** The angel of the Lord is ever watching over those who have fear of him, to keep them safe.

**⁸** By experience you will see that the Lord is good; happy is the man who has faith in him.

**⁹** Keep yourselves in the fear of the Lord, all you his saints; for those who do so will have no need of anything.

**¹⁰** The young lions are in need and have no food; but those who are looking to the Lord will have every good thing.

**¹¹** Come, children, give attention to me; I will be your teacher in the fear of the Lord.

**¹²** What man has a love of life, and a desire that his days may be increased so that he may see good?

**¹³** Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from words of deceit.

**¹⁴** Be turned from evil, and do good; make a search for peace, desiring it with all your heart.

**¹⁵** The eyes of the Lord are on the upright, and his ears are open to their cry.

**¹⁶** The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to take away the memory of them from the earth.

**¹⁷** The cry of the upright comes before the Lord, and he takes them out of all their troubles.

**¹⁸** The Lord is near the broken-hearted; he is the saviour of those whose spirits are crushed down.

**¹⁹** Great are the troubles of the upright: but the Lord takes him safely out of them all.

**²⁰** He keeps all his bones: not one of them is broken.

**²¹** Evil will put an end to the sinner, and those who are haters of righteousness will come to destruction.

**²²** The Lord will be the saviour of the souls of his servants, and no one who has faith in him will be put to shame.
