# Psalm 123

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. To you my eyes are lifted up, even to you whose seat is in the heavens. 

<sup>2</sup> See! as the eyes of servants are turned to the hands of their masters, and the eyes of a servant-girl to her owner, so our eyes are waiting for the Lord our God, till he has mercy on us. 

<sup>3</sup> Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us: for all men are looking down on us. 

<sup>4</sup> For long enough have men of pride made sport of our soul.
