# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> A lover of training is a lover of knowledge; but a hater of teaching is like a beast. 

<sup>2</sup> A good man has grace in the eyes of the Lord; but the man of evil designs gets punishment from him. 

<sup>3</sup> No man will make himself safe through evil-doing; but the root of upright men will never be moved. 

<sup>4</sup> A woman of virtue is a crown to her husband; but she whose behaviour is a cause of shame is like a wasting disease in his bones. 

<sup>5</sup> The purposes of upright men are right, but the designs of evil-doers are deceit. 

<sup>6</sup> The words of sinners are destruction for the upright; but the mouth of upright men is their salvation. 

<sup>7</sup> Evil-doers are overturned and never seen again, but the house of upright men will keep its place. 

<sup>8</sup> A man will be praised in the measure of his wisdom, but a wrong-minded man will be looked down on. 

<sup>9</sup> He who is of low position and has a servant, is better than one who has a high opinion of himself and is in need of bread. 

<sup>10</sup> An upright man has thought for the life of his beast, but the hearts of evil-doers are cruel. 

<sup>11</sup> He who does work on his land will not be short of bread; but he who goes after foolish men is without sense. 

<sup>12</sup> The resting-place of the sinner will come to destruction, but the root of upright men is for ever. 

<sup>13</sup> In the sin of the lips is a net which takes the sinner, but the upright man will come out of trouble. 

<sup>14</sup> From the fruit of his mouth will a man have good food in full measure, and the work of a man's hands will be rewarded. 

<sup>15</sup> The way of the foolish man seems right to him? but the wise man gives ear to suggestions. 

<sup>16</sup> A foolish man lets his trouble be openly seen, but a sharp man keeps shame secret. 

<sup>17</sup> The breathing out of true words gives knowledge of righteousness; but a false witness gives out deceit. 

<sup>18</sup> There are some whose uncontrolled talk is like the wounds of a sword, but the tongue of the wise makes one well again. 

<sup>19</sup> True lips are certain for ever, but a false tongue is only for a minute. 

<sup>20</sup> Deceit is in the heart of those whose designs are evil, but for those purposing peace there is joy. 

<sup>21</sup> No trouble will come to upright men, but sinners will be full of evil. 

<sup>22</sup> False lips are hated by the Lord, but those whose acts are true are his delight. 

<sup>23</sup> A sharp man keeps back his knowledge; but the heart of foolish men makes clear their foolish thoughts. 

<sup>24</sup> The hand of the ready worker will have authority, but he who is slow in his work will be put to forced work. 

<sup>25</sup> Care in the heart of a man makes it weighted down, but a good word makes it glad. 

<sup>26</sup> The upright man is a guide to his neighbour, but the way of evil-doers is a cause of error to them. 

<sup>27</sup> He who is slow in his work does not go in search of food; but the ready worker gets much wealth. 

<sup>28</sup> In the road of righteousness is life, but the way of the evil-doer goes to death.
