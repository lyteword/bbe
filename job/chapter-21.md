# Chapter 21

**¹** Then Job made answer and said,

**²** Give attention with care to my words; and let this be your comfort.

**³** Let me say what is in my mind, and after that, go on making sport of me.

**⁴** As for me, is my outcry against man? is it then to be wondered at if my spirit is troubled?

**⁵** Take note of me and be full of wonder, put your hand on your mouth.

**⁶** At the very thought of it my flesh is shaking with fear.

**⁷** Why is life given to the evil-doers? why do they become old and strong in power?

**⁸** Their children are ever with them, and their offspring before their eyes.

**⁹** Their houses are free from fear, and the rod of God does not come on them.

**¹⁰** Their ox is ready at all times to give seed; their cow gives birth, without dropping her young.

**¹¹** They send out their young ones like a flock, and their children have pleasure in the dance,

**¹²** They make songs to the instruments of music, and are glad at the sound of the pipe.

**¹³** Their days come to an end without trouble, and suddenly they go down to the underworld.

**¹⁴** Though they said to God, Go away from us, for we have no desire for the knowledge of your ways.

**¹⁵** What is the Ruler of all, that we may give him worship? and what profit is it to us to make prayer to him?

**¹⁶** Truly, is not their well-being in their power? (The purpose of the evil-doers is far from me.)

**¹⁷** How frequently is the light of the evil-doers put out, or does trouble come on them? how frequently does his wrath take them with cords?

**¹⁸** How frequently are they as dry stems before the wind, or as grass taken away by the storm-wind?

**¹⁹** You say, God keeps punishment stored up for his children. Let him send it on the man himself, so that he may have the punishment of it!

**²⁰** Let his eyes see his trouble, and let him be full of the wrath of the Ruler of all!

**²¹** For what interest has he in his house after him, when the number of his months is ended?

**²²** Is anyone able to give teaching to God? for he is the judge of those who are on high.

**²³** One comes to his end in complete well-being, full of peace and quiet:

**²⁴** His buckets are full of milk, and there is no loss of strength in his bones.

**²⁵** And another comes to his end with a bitter soul, without ever tasting good.

**²⁶** Together they go down to the dust, and are covered by the worm.

**²⁷** See, I am conscious of your thoughts, and of your violent purposes against me;

**²⁸** For you say, Where is the house of the ruler, and where is the tent of the evil-doer?

**²⁹** Have you not put the question to the travellers, and do you not take note of their experience?

**³⁰** How the evil man goes free in the day of trouble, and has salvation in the day of wrath?

**³¹** Who will make his way clear to his face? and if he has done a thing, who gives him punishment for it?

**³²** He is taken to his last resting-place, and keeps watch over it.

**³³** The earth of the valley covering his bones is sweet to him, and all men come after him, as there were unnumbered before him.

**³⁴** Why then do you give me comfort with words in which there is no profit, when you see that there is nothing in your answers but deceit?
