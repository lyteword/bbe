# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Is it possible for a man to be of profit to God? No, for a man's wisdom is only of profit to himself. 

<sup>3</sup> Is it of any interest to the Ruler of all that you are upright? or is it of use to him that your ways are without sin? 

<sup>4</sup> Is it because you give him honour that he is sending punishment on you and is judging you? 

<sup>5</sup> Is not your evil-doing great? and there is no end to your sins. 

<sup>6</sup> For you have taken your brother's goods when he was not in your debt, and have taken away the clothing of those who have need of it. 

<sup>7</sup> You do not give water to the tired traveller, and from him who has no food you keep back bread. 

<sup>8</sup> For it was the man with power who had the land, and the man with an honoured name who was living in it. 

<sup>9</sup> You have sent widows away without hearing their cause, and you have taken away the support of the child who has no father. 

<sup>10</sup> For this cause nets are round your feet, and you are overcome with sudden fear. 

<sup>11</sup> Your light is made dark so that you are unable to see, and you are covered by a mass of waters. 

<sup>12</sup> Is not God as high as heaven? and see the stars, how high they are! 

<sup>13</sup> And you say, What knowledge has God? is he able to give decisions through the deep dark? 

<sup>14</sup> Thick clouds are covering him, so that he is unable to see; and he is walking on the arch of heaven. 

<sup>15</sup> Will you keep the old way by which evil men went? 

<sup>16</sup> Who were violently taken away before their time, who were overcome by the rush of waters: 

<sup>17</sup> Who said to God, Go away from us; and, What is the Ruler of all able to do to us? 

<sup>18</sup> Though he made their houses full of good things: but the purpose of the evil-doers is far from me! 

<sup>19</sup> The upright saw it and were glad: and those who had done no wrong made sport of them, 

<sup>20</sup> Saying, Truly, their substance is cut off, and their wealth is food for the fire. 

<sup>21</sup> Put yourself now in a right relation with him and be at peace: so will you do well in your undertakings. 

<sup>22</sup> Be pleased to take teaching from his mouth, and let his words be stored up in your heart. 

<sup>23</sup> If you come back to the Ruler of all, making yourself low before him; if you put evil far away from your tents; 

<sup>24</sup> And put your gold in the dust, even your gold of Ophir among the rocks of the valleys; 

<sup>25</sup> Then the Ruler of all will be your gold, and his teaching will be your silver; 

<sup>26</sup> For then you will have delight in the Ruler of all, and your face will be lifted up to God. 

<sup>27</sup> You will make your prayer to him, and be answered; and you will give effect to your oaths. 

<sup>28</sup> Your purposes will come about, and light will be shining on your ways. 

<sup>29</sup> For God makes low those whose hearts are lifted up, but he is a saviour to the poor in spirit. 

<sup>30</sup> He makes safe the man who is free from sin, and if your hands are clean, salvation will be yours.
