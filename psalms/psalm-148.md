# Psalm 148

<sup>1</sup> Give praise to the Lord. Let the Lord be praised from the heavens: give him praise in the skies. 

<sup>2</sup> Give praise to him, all you his angels: give praise to him, all his armies. 

<sup>3</sup> Give praise to him, you sun and moon: give praise to him, all you stars of light. 

<sup>4</sup> Give praise to him, you highest heavens, and you waters which are over the heavens. 

<sup>5</sup> Let them give praise to the name of the Lord: for he gave the order, and they were made. 

<sup>6</sup> He has put them in their places for ever; he has given them their limits which may not be broken. 

<sup>7</sup> Give praise to the Lord from the earth, you great sea-beasts, and deep places: 

<sup>8</sup> Fire and rain of ice, snow and mists; storm-wind, doing his word: 

<sup>9</sup> Mountains and all hills; fruit-trees and all trees of the mountains: 

<sup>10</sup> Beasts and all cattle; insects and winged birds: 

<sup>11</sup> Kings of the earth, and all peoples; rulers and all judges of the earth: 

<sup>12</sup> Young men and virgins; old men and children: 

<sup>13</sup> Let them give glory to the name of the Lord: for his name only is to be praised: his kingdom is over the earth and the heaven. 

<sup>14</sup> He has put on high the horn of his people, for the praise of all his saints; even the children of Israel, a people which is near to him. Let the Lord be praised.
