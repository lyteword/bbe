# Psalm 64

To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.

<sup>1</sup> O God, let the voice of my grief come to your ear: keep my life from the fear of those who are against me.

<sup>2</sup> Keep me safe from the secret purpose of wrongdoers; from the band of the workers of evil;

<sup>3</sup> Who make their tongues sharp like a sword, and whose arrows are pointed, even bitter words;

<sup>4</sup> So that in secret they may let loose their arrows at the upright, suddenly and unseen.

<sup>5</sup> They make themselves strong in an evil purpose; they make holes for secret nets; they say, Who will see it,

<sup>6</sup> Or make discovery of our secret purpose? The design is framed with care; and the inner thought of a man, and his heart, is deep.

<sup>7</sup> But God sends out an arrow against them; suddenly they are wounded.

<sup>8</sup> The evil of their tongues is the cause of their fall; all those who see them are shaking their heads at them.

<sup>9</sup> And in fear men make public the works of God; and giving thought to his acts they get wisdom.

<sup>10</sup> The upright will be glad in the Lord and have hope in him; and all the lovers of righteousness will give him glory.
