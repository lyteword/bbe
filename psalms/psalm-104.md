# Psalm 104

<sup>1</sup> Give praise to the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, you are very great; you are robed with honour and power. 

<sup>2</sup> You are clothed with light as with a robe; stretching out the heavens like a curtain: 

<sup>3</sup> The arch of your house is based on the waters; you make the clouds your carriage; you go on the wings of the wind: 

<sup>4</sup> He makes winds his angels, and flames of fire his servants. 

<sup>5</sup> He has made the earth strong on its bases, so that it may not be moved for ever and ever; 

<sup>6</sup> Covering it with the sea as with a robe: the waters were high over the mountains; 

<sup>7</sup> At the voice of your word they went in flight; at the sound of your thunder they went away in fear; 

<sup>8</sup> The mountains came up and the valleys went down into the place which you had made ready for them. 

<sup>9</sup> You made a limit over which they might not go, so that the earth would never again be covered by them. 

<sup>10</sup> You sent the springs into the valleys; they are flowing between the hills. 

<sup>11</sup> They give drink to every beast of the field; the mountain asses come to them for water. 

<sup>12</sup> The birds of the air have their resting-places by them, and make their song among the branches. 

<sup>13</sup> He sends down rain from his store-houses on the hills: the earth is full of the fruit of his works. 

<sup>14</sup> He makes the grass come up for the cattle, and plants for the use of man; so that bread may come out of the earth; 

<sup>15</sup> And wine to make glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face shining, and bread giving strength to his heart. 

<sup>16</sup> The trees of the Lord are full of growth, the cedars of Lebanon of his planting; 

<sup>17</sup> Where the birds have their resting-places; as for the stork, the tall trees are her house. 

<sup>18</sup> The high hills are a safe place for the mountain goats, and the rocks for the small beasts. 

<sup>19</sup> He made the moon for a sign of the divisions of the year; teaching the sun the time of its going down. 

<sup>20</sup> When you make it dark, it is night, when all the beasts of the woods come quietly out of their secret places. 

<sup>21</sup> The young lions go thundering after their food; searching for their meat from God. 

<sup>22</sup> The sun comes up, and they come together, and go back to their secret places to take their rest. 

<sup>23</sup> Man goes out to his work, and to his business, till the evening. 

<sup>24</sup> O Lord, how great is the number of your works! in wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of the things you have made. 

<sup>25</sup> There is the great, wide sea, where there are living things, great and small, more than may be numbered. 

<sup>26</sup> There go the ships; there is that great beast, which you have made as a plaything. 

<sup>27</sup> All of them are waiting for you, to give them their food in its time. 

<sup>28</sup> They take what you give them; they are full of the good things which come from your open hand. 

<sup>29</sup> If your face is veiled, they are troubled; when you take away their breath, they come to an end, and go back to the dust. 

<sup>30</sup> If you send out your spirit, they are given life; you make new the face of the earth. 

<sup>31</sup> Let the glory of the Lord be for ever; let the Lord have joy in his works: 

<sup>32</sup> At whose look the earth is shaking; at whose touch the mountains send out smoke. 

<sup>33</sup> I will make songs to the Lord all my life; I will make melody to my God while I have my being. 

<sup>34</sup> Let my thoughts be sweet to him: I will be glad in the Lord. 

<sup>35</sup> Let sinners be cut off from the earth, and let all evil-doers come to an end. Give praise to the Lord, O my soul. Give praise to the Lord.
