# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> My son, if you have made yourself responsible for your neighbour, or given your word for another, 

<sup>2</sup> You are taken as in a net by the words of your mouth, the sayings of your lips have overcome you. 

<sup>3</sup> Do this, my son, and make yourself free, because you have come into the power of your neighbour; go without waiting, and make a strong request to your neighbour. 

<sup>4</sup> Give no sleep to your eyes, or rest to them; 

<sup>5</sup> Make yourself free, like the roe from the hand of the archer, and the bird from him who puts a net for her. 

<sup>6</sup> Go to the ant, you hater of work; give thought to her ways and be wise: 

<sup>7</sup> Having no chief, overseer, or ruler, 

<sup>8</sup> She gets her meat in the summer, storing up food at the time of the grain-cutting. 

<sup>9</sup> How long will you be sleeping, O hater of work? when will you get up from your sleep? 

<sup>10</sup> A little sleep, a little rest, a little folding of the hands in sleep: 

<sup>11</sup> Then loss will come on you like an outlaw, and your need like an armed man 

<sup>12</sup> A good-for-nothing man is an evil-doer; he goes on his way causing trouble with false words; 

<sup>13</sup> Making signs with his eyes, rubbing with his feet, and giving news with his fingers; 

<sup>14</sup> His mind is ever designing evil: he lets loose violent acts. 

<sup>15</sup> For this cause his downfall will be sudden; quickly he will be broken, and there will be no help for him. 

<sup>16</sup> Six things are hated by the Lord; seven things are disgusting to him: 

<sup>17</sup> Eyes of pride, a false tongue, hands which take life without cause; 

<sup>18</sup> A heart full of evil designs, feet which are quick in running after sin; 

<sup>19</sup> A false witness, breathing out untrue words, and one who lets loose violent acts among brothers. 

<sup>20</sup> My son, keep the rule of your father, and have in memory the teaching of your mother: 

<sup>21</sup> Keep them ever folded in your heart, and have them hanging round your neck. 

<sup>22</sup> In your walking, it will be your guide; when you are sleeping, it will keep watch over you; when you are awake, it will have talk with you. 

<sup>23</sup> For the rule is a light, and the teaching a shining light; and the guiding words of training are the way of life. 

<sup>24</sup> They will keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the strange woman. 

<sup>25</sup> Let not your heart's desire go after her fair body; let not her eyes take you prisoner. 

<sup>26</sup> For a loose woman is looking for a cake of bread, but another man's wife goes after one's very life. 

<sup>27</sup> May a man take fire to his breast without burning his clothing? 

<sup>28</sup> Or may one go on lighted coals, and his feet not be burned? 

<sup>29</sup> So it is with him who goes in to his neighbour's wife; he who has anything to do with her will not go free from punishment. 

<sup>30</sup> Men do not have a low opinion of a thief who takes food when he is in need of it: 

<sup>31</sup> But if he is taken in the act he will have to give back seven times as much, giving up all his property which is in his house. 

<sup>32</sup> He who takes another man's wife is without all sense: he who does it is the cause of destruction to his soul. 

<sup>33</sup> Wounds will be his and loss of honour, and his shame may not be washed away. 

<sup>34</sup> For bitter is the wrath of an angry husband; in the day of punishment he will have no mercy. 

<sup>35</sup> He will not take any payment; and he will not make peace with you though your money offerings are increased.
