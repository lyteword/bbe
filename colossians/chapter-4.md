# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Masters, give your servants what is right and equal, conscious that you have a Master in heaven.

<sup>2</sup> Give yourselves to prayer at all times, keeping watch with praise;

<sup>3</sup> And making prayer for us, that God may give us an open door for the preaching of the word, the secret of Christ, for which I am now in chains;

<sup>4</sup> So that I may make it clear, as it is right for me to do.

<sup>5</sup> Be wise in your behaviour to those who are outside, making good use of the time.

<sup>6</sup> Let your talk be with grace, mixed with salt, so that you may be able to give an answer to everyone.

<sup>7</sup> Tychicus will give you news of all my business: he is a dear brother and true servant and helper in the word;

<sup>8</sup> And I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may have news of how we are, and so that he may give your hearts comfort;

<sup>9</sup> And with him I have sent Onesimus, the true and well-loved brother, who is one of you. They will give you word of everything which is taking place here.

<sup>10</sup> Aristarchus, my brother-prisoner, sends his love to you, and Mark, a relation of Barnabas (about whom you have been given orders: if he comes to you, be kind to him),

<sup>11</sup> And Jesus, whose other name is Justus; these are of the circumcision: they are my only brother-workers for the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me.

<sup>12</sup> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his love, ever taking thought for you in his prayers, that you may be complete and fully certain of all the purpose of God.

<sup>13</sup> For I give witness of him that he has undergone much trouble for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.

<sup>14</sup> Luke, our well-loved medical friend, and Demas, send you their love.

<sup>15</sup> Give my love to the brothers in Laodicea and to Nymphas and the church in their house.

<sup>16</sup> And when this letter has been made public among you, let the same be done in the church of Laodicea; and see that you have the letter from Laodicea.

<sup>17</sup> Say to Archippus, See that you do the work which the Lord has given you to do.

<sup>18</sup> I, Paul, give you this word of love in my handwriting. Keep in memory that I am a prisoner. Grace be with you.
