# Psalm 102

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of the man who is in trouble, when he is overcome, and puts his grief before the Lord. Give ear to my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come to you. 

<sup>2</sup> Let not your face be veiled from me in the day of my trouble; give ear to me, and let my cry be answered quickly. 

<sup>3</sup> My days are wasted like smoke, and my bones are burned up as in a fire. 

<sup>4</sup> My heart is broken; it has become dry and dead like grass, so that I give no thought to food. 

<sup>5</sup> Because of the voice of my sorrow, my flesh is wasted to the bone. 

<sup>6</sup> I am like a bird living by itself in the waste places; like the night-bird in a waste of sand. 

<sup>7</sup> I keep watch like a bird by itself on the house-top. 

<sup>8</sup> My haters say evil of me all day; those who are violent against me make use of my name as a curse. 

<sup>9</sup> I have had dust for bread and my drink has been mixed with weeping: 

<sup>10</sup> Because of your passion and your wrath, for I have been lifted up and then made low by you. 

<sup>11</sup> My days are like a shade which is stretched out; I am dry like the grass. 

<sup>12</sup> But you, O Lord, are eternal; and your name will never come to an end. 

<sup>13</sup> You will again get up and have mercy on Zion: for the time has come for her to be comforted. 

<sup>14</sup> For your servants take pleasure in her stones, looking with love on her dust. 

<sup>15</sup> So the nations will give honour to the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth will be in fear of his glory: 

<sup>16</sup> When the Lord has put up the walls of Zion, and has been been in his glory; 

<sup>17</sup> When he has given ear to the prayer of the poor, and has not put his request on one side. 

<sup>18</sup> This will be put in writing for the coming generation, and the people of the future will give praise to the Lord. 

<sup>19</sup> For from his holy place the Lord has seen, looking down on the earth from heaven; 

<sup>20</sup> Hearing the cry of the prisoner, making free those for whom death is ordered; 

<sup>21</sup> So that they may give out the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 

<sup>22</sup> When the peoples are come together, and the kingdoms, to give worship to the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> He has taken my strength from me in the way; he has made short my days. 

<sup>24</sup> I will say, O my God, take me not away before my time; your years go on through all generations: 

<sup>25</sup> In the past you put the earth on its base, and the heavens are the work of your hands. 

<sup>26</sup> They will come to an end, but you will still go on; they all will become old like a coat, and like a robe they will be changed: 

<sup>27</sup> But you are the unchanging One, and your years will have no end. 

<sup>28</sup> The children of your servants will have a safe resting-place, and their seed will be ever before you.
