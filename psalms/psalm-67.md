# Psalm 67

To the chief music-maker. With corded instruments. A Psalm. A Song.

<sup>1</sup> May God give us mercy and blessing, and let the light of his face be shining on us; (Selah.)

<sup>2</sup> So that men may see your way on the earth, and your salvation among all nations.

<sup>3</sup> Let the peoples give you praise, O God; let all the peoples give you praise.

<sup>4</sup> O let the nations be glad, and make song of joy; for you will be the judge of the peoples in righteousness, guiding the nations of the earth. (Selah.)

<sup>5</sup> Let the peoples give you praise, O God; let all the peoples give you praise.

<sup>6</sup> The earth has given her increase; and God, even our God, will give us his blessing.

<sup>7</sup> God will give us his blessing; so let all the ends of the earth be in fear of him.
