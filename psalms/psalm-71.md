# Psalm 71

<sup>1</sup> In you, O Lord, have I put my hope; let me never be shamed. 

<sup>2</sup> Keep me safe in your righteousness, and come to my help; give ear to my voice, and be my saviour. 

<sup>3</sup> Be my strong Rock, the strong place of my salvation; for you are my Rock, and my safe place. 

<sup>4</sup> O my God, take me out of the hand of the sinner, out of the hand of the evil and cruel man. 

<sup>5</sup> For you are my hope, O Lord God; I have had faith in you from the time when I was young. 

<sup>6</sup> You have been my support from the day of my birth; you took me out of my mother's body; my praise will be ever of you. 

<sup>7</sup> I am a wonder to all; but you are my strong tower. 

<sup>8</sup> My mouth will be full of your praise and glory all the day. 

<sup>9</sup> Do not give me up when I am old; be my help even when my strength is gone. 

<sup>10</sup> For my haters are waiting secretly for me; and those who are watching for my soul are banded together in their evil designs, 

<sup>11</sup> Saying, God has given him up; go after him and take him, for he has no helper. 

<sup>12</sup> O God, be not far from me; O my God, come quickly to my help. 

<sup>13</sup> Let those who say evil against my soul be overcome and put to shame; let my haters be made low and have no honour. 

<sup>14</sup> But I will go on ever hoping, and increasing in all your praise. 

<sup>15</sup> My mouth will make clear your righteousness and your salvation all the day; for they are more than may be measured. 

<sup>16</sup> I will give news of the great acts of the Lord God; my words will be of your righteousness, and of yours only. 

<sup>17</sup> O God, you have been my teacher from the time when I was young; and I have been talking of your works of wonder even till now. 

<sup>18</sup> Now when I am old and grey-headed, O God, give me not up; till I have made clear your strength to this generation, and your power to all those to come. 

<sup>19</sup> Your righteousness, O God, is very high; you have done great things; O God, who is like you? 

<sup>20</sup> You, who have sent great and bitter troubles on me, will give me life again, lifting me up from the deep waters of the underworld. 

<sup>21</sup> You will make me greater than before, and give me comfort on every side. 

<sup>22</sup> I will give praise to you with instruments of music, O my God, for you are true; I will make songs to you with music, O Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>23</sup> Joy will be on my lips when I make melody to you; and in my soul, to which you have given salvation. 

<sup>24</sup> My tongue will be talking of your righteousness all the day; for those whose purpose is to do me evil have been crushed and put to shame.
