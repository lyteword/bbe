# Psalm 110

A Psalm. Of David.

**¹** The Lord said to my lord, Be seated at my right hand, till I put all those who are against you under your feet.

**²** The Lord will send out the rod of your strength from Zion; be king over your haters.

**³** Your people give themselves gladly in the day of your power; like the dew of the morning on the holy mountains is the army of your young men.

**⁴** The Lord has made an oath, and will not take it back. You are a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.

**⁵** In the day of his wrath kings will be wounded by the Lord at your right hand.

**⁶** He will be judge among the nations, the valleys will be full of dead bodies; the head over a great country will be wounded by him.

**⁷** He will take of the stream by the way; so his head will be lifted up.
