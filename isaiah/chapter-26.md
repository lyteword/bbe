# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> In that day will this song be made in the land of Judah: We have a strong town; he will make salvation our walls and towers. 

<sup>2</sup> Let the doors be open, so that the upright nation which keeps faith may come in. 

<sup>3</sup> The man whose heart is unmoved you will keep in peace, because his hope is in you. 

<sup>4</sup> Let your hope be in the Lord for ever: for the Lord Jah is an unchanging Rock. 

<sup>5</sup> For he has made low those who are lifted up, all the people of the town of pride: he makes it low, crushing it down to the earth; he makes it low in the dust. 

<sup>6</sup> It will be crushed under the feet of the poor and the steps of those who are in need. 

<sup>7</sup> The way of the good man is straight; the road of the upright is made smooth by you. 

<sup>8</sup> We have been waiting for you, O Lord; the desire of our soul is for the memory of your name. 

<sup>9</sup> In the night the desire of my soul has been for you; early will my spirit be searching for you; for when your punishments come on the earth, the people of the world will get the knowledge of righteousness. 

<sup>10</sup> Even if you are kind to the evil-doer, he will not go after righteousness; even in the land of the upright he will still go on in his wrongdoing, and will not see the glory of the Lord. 

<sup>11</sup> Lord, your hand is lifted up, but they do not see: let them see ... yes, your haters will be burned up in the fire. 

<sup>12</sup> Lord, you will give us peace: for all our works are the outcome of your purpose. 

<sup>13</sup> O Lord, our God, other lords than you have had rule over us; but in you only is our salvation, and no other name will we take on our lips. 

<sup>14</sup> The dead will not come back to life: their spirits will not come back to earth; for this cause you have sent destruction on them, so that the memory of them is dead. 

<sup>15</sup> You have made the nation great, O Lord, you have made it great; glory is yours: you have made wide the limits of the land. 

<sup>16</sup> Lord, in trouble our eyes have been turned to you, we sent up a prayer when your punishment was on us. 

<sup>17</sup> As a woman with child, whose time is near, is troubled, crying out in her pain; so have we been before you, O Lord. 

<sup>18</sup> We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have given birth to wind; no salvation has come to the earth through us, and no children have come into the world. 

<sup>19</sup> Your dead will come back; their dead bodies will come to life again. Those in the dust, awaking from their sleep, will send out a song; for your dew is a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the shades. 

<sup>20</sup> Come, my people, into your secret places, and let your doors be shut: keep yourself safe for a short time, till his wrath is over. 

<sup>21</sup> For the Lord is coming out of his place to send punishment on the people of the earth for their evil-doing: the earth will let the blood drained out on her be seen, and will keep her dead covered no longer.
