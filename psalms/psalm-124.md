# Psalm 124

A Song of the going up. Of David.

**¹** If it had not been the Lord who was on our side (let Israel now say);

**²** If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men came up against us;

**³** They would have made a meal of us while still living, in the heat of their wrath against us:

**⁴** We would have been covered by the waters; the streams would have gone over our soul;

**⁵** Yes, the waters of pride would have gone over our soul.

**⁶** Praise be to the Lord, who has not let us be wounded by their teeth.

**⁷** Our soul has gone free like a bird out of the net of those who would take her: the net is broken, and we are free.

**⁸** Our help is in the name of the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
