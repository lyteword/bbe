# Psalm 118

**¹** O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.

**²** Let Israel now say, that his mercy is unchanging for ever.

**³** Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy is unchanging for ever.

**⁴** Let all worshippers of the Lord now say, that his mercy is unchanging for ever.

**⁵** I made my prayer to the Lord in my trouble: and the Lord gave me an answer, and put me in a wide place.

**⁶** The Lord is on my side; I will have no fear: what is man able to do to me?

**⁷** The Lord is my great helper: I will see my desire against my haters.

**⁸** It is better to have faith in the Lord than to put one's hope in man.

**⁹** It is better to have faith in the Lord than to put one's hope in rulers.

**¹⁰** All the nations have come round me; but in the name of the Lord I will have them cut down.

**¹¹** They are round me, yes, they are all about me; but in the name of the Lord I will have them cut down.

**¹²** They are round me like bees; but they are put out like a fire among thorns; for in the name of the Lord I will have them cut down.

**¹³** I have been hard pushed by you, so that I might have a fall: but the Lord was my helper.

**¹⁴** The Lord is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.

**¹⁵** The sound of joy and salvation is in the tents of the upright; the right hand of the Lord does works of power.

**¹⁶** The right hand of the Lord is lifted up; the right hand of the Lord does works of power.

**¹⁷** Life and not death will be my part, and I will give out the story of the works of the Lord.

**¹⁸** The hand of Jah has been hard on me; but he has not given me up to death.

**¹⁹** Let the doors of righteousness be open to me; I will go in and give praise to the Lord.

**²⁰** This is the door of the Lord's house; the workers of righteousness will go in through it.

**²¹** I will give you praise, for you have given me an answer, and have become my salvation.

**²²** The stone which the builders put on one side has become the chief stone of the building.

**²³** This is the Lord's doing; it is a wonder in our eyes.

**²⁴** This is the day which the Lord has made; we will be full of joy and delight in it.

**²⁵** Send salvation now, O Lord; Lord, send us your blessing.

**²⁶** A blessing be on him who comes in the name of the Lord; we give you blessing from the house of the Lord.

**²⁷** The Lord is God, and he has given us light; let the holy dance be ordered with branches, even up to the horns of the altar.

**²⁸** You are my God, and I will give you praise; my God, and I will give honour to your name.

**²⁹** O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.
