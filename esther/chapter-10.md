# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> And King Ahasuerus put a tax on the land and on the islands of the sea. 

<sup>2</sup> And all his acts of power and his great strength and the full story of the high place which the king gave Mordecai, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Media and Persia? 

<sup>3</sup> For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews and respected by the body of his countrymen; working for the good of his people, and saying words of peace to all his seed.
