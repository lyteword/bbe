# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> Truly there is a mine for silver, and a place where gold is washed out. 

<sup>2</sup> Iron is taken out of the earth, and stone is changed into brass by the fire. 

<sup>3</sup> Man puts an end to the dark, searching out to the farthest limit the stones of the deep places of the dark. 

<sup>4</sup> He makes a deep mine far away from those living in the light of day; when they go about on the earth, they have no knowledge of those who are under them, who are hanging far from men, twisting from side to side on a cord. 

<sup>5</sup> As for the earth, bread comes out of it; but under its face it is turned up as if by fire. 

<sup>6</sup> Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold. 

<sup>7</sup> No bird has knowledge of it, and the hawk's eye has never seen it. 

<sup>8</sup> The great beasts have not gone over it, and the cruel lion has not taken that way. 

<sup>9</sup> Man puts out his hand on the hard rock, overturning mountains by the roots. 

<sup>10</sup> He makes deep ways, cut through the rock, and his eye sees everything of value. 

<sup>11</sup> He keeps back the streams from flowing, and makes the secret things come out into the light. 

<sup>12</sup> But where may wisdom be seen? and where is the resting-place of knowledge? 

<sup>13</sup> Man has not seen the way to it, and it is not in the land of the living. 

<sup>14</sup> The deep waters say, It is not in me: and the sea says, It is not with me. 

<sup>15</sup> Gold may not be given for it, or a weight of silver in payment for it. 

<sup>16</sup> It may not be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the onyx of great price, or the sapphire. 

<sup>17</sup> Gold and glass are not equal to it in price, and it may not be exchanged for jewels of the best gold. 

<sup>18</sup> There is no need to say anything about coral or crystal; and the value of wisdom is greater than that of pearls. 

<sup>19</sup> The topaz of Ethiopia is not equal to it, and it may not be valued with the best gold. 

<sup>20</sup> From where then does wisdom come, and where is the resting-place of knowledge? 

<sup>21</sup> For it is kept secret from the eyes of all living, unseen by the birds of the air. 

<sup>22</sup> Destruction and Death say, We have only had word of it with our ears. 

<sup>23</sup> God has knowledge of the way to it, and of its resting-place; 

<sup>24</sup> For his eyes go to the ends of the earth, and he sees everything under heaven. 

<sup>25</sup> When he made a weight for the wind, measuring out the waters; 

<sup>26</sup> When he made a law for the rain, and a way for the thunder-flames; 

<sup>27</sup> Then he saw it, and put it on record; he gave it its fixed form, searching it out completely. 

<sup>28</sup> And he said to man, Truly the fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to keep from evil is the way to knowledge.
