# Psalm 40 

To the chief music-maker. Of David. A Psalm.

**¹** When I was waiting quietly for the Lord, his heart was turned to me, and he gave ear to my cry.

**²** He took me up out of a deep waste place, out of the soft and sticky earth; he put my feet on a rock, and made my steps certain.

**³** And he put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God; numbers have seen it with fear, and put their faith in the Lord.

**⁴** Happy is the man who has faith in the Lord, and does not give honour to the men of pride or to those who are turned away to deceit.

**⁵** O Lord my God, great are the wonders which you have done in your thought for us; it is not possible to put them out in order before you; when I would give an account of them, their number is greater than I may say.

**⁶** You had no desire for offerings of beasts or fruits of the earth; ears you made for me: for burned offerings and sin offerings you made no request.

**⁷** Then I said, See, I come; it is recorded of me in the roll of the book,

**⁸** My delight is to do your pleasure, O my God; truly, your law is in my heart.

**⁹** I have given news of righteousness in the great meeting; O Lord, you have knowledge that I have not kept back my words.

**¹⁰** Your righteousness has not been folded away in my heart; I have made clear your true word and your salvation; I have not kept secret your mercy or your faith from the great meeting.

**¹¹** Take not away your gentle mercies from me, O Lord; let your mercy and your faith keep me safe for ever.

**¹²** For unnumbered evils are round about me; my sins have overtaken me, so that I am bent down with their weight; they are more than the hairs of my head, my strength is gone because of them.

**¹³** Be pleased, O Lord, to take me out of danger; O Lord, come quickly and give me help.

**¹⁴** Let those who go after my soul for its destruction have shame and trouble together; let them be turned back and made foolish who take pleasure in my trouble.

**¹⁵** Let those who say to me, Aha, aha! be surprised because of their shame.

**¹⁶** Let all those who are looking for you be glad and have joy in you; let the lovers of your salvation ever say, May the Lord be great.

**¹⁷** Though I am poor and in need, the Lord has me in mind; you are my help and my saviour; let there be no waiting, O my God.
