# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> And Abram went up out of Egypt with his wife and all he had, and Lot with him, and they came in to the South. 

<sup>2</sup> Now Abram had great wealth of cattle and silver and gold. 

<sup>3</sup> And travelling on from the South, he came to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been before, between Beth-el and Ai; 

<sup>4</sup> To the place where he had made his first altar, and there Abram gave worship to the name of the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> And Lot, who went with him, had flocks and herds and tents; 

<sup>6</sup> So that the land was not wide enough for the two of them: their property was so great that there was not room for them together. 

<sup>7</sup> And there was an argument between the keepers of Abram's cattle and the keepers of Lot's cattle: at that time the Canaanites and Perizzites were still living in the land. 

<sup>8</sup> Then Abram said to Lot, Let there be no argument between me and you, and between my herdmen and your herdmen, for we are brothers. 

<sup>9</sup> Is not all the land before you? then let us go our separate ways: if you go to the left, I will go to the right; or if you take the right, I will go to the left. 

<sup>10</sup> And Lot, lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of Jordan, saw that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord had sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah; it was like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, on the way to Zoar. 

<sup>11</sup> So Lot took for himself all the valley of Jordan, and went to the east, and they were parted from one another. 

<sup>12</sup> Abram went on living in the land of Canaan, and Lot went to the lowland towns, moving his tent as far as Sodom. 

<sup>13</sup> Now the men of Sodom were evil, and great sinners before the Lord. 

<sup>14</sup> And the Lord had said to Abram, after Lot was parted from him, From this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west: 

<sup>15</sup> For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your seed for ever. 

<sup>16</sup> And I will make your children like the dust of the earth, so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered, then will your children be numbered. 

<sup>17</sup> Come, go through all the land from one end to the other for I will give it to you. 

<sup>18</sup> And Abram, moving his tent, came and made his living-place by the holy tree of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and made an altar there to the Lord.
