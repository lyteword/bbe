# Chapter 46

<sup>1</sup> And Israel went on his journey with all he had, and came to Beer-sheba, where he made offerings to the God of his father Isaac. 

<sup>2</sup> And God said to Israel in a night-vision, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. 

<sup>3</sup> And he said, I am God, the God of your father: go down to Egypt without fear, for I will make a great nation of you there: 

<sup>4</sup> I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will see that you come back again, and at your death Joseph will put his hands on your eyes. 

<sup>5</sup> Then Jacob went on from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Jacob took their father and their little ones and their wives in the carts which Pharaoh had sent for them. 

<sup>6</sup> And they took their cattle and all the goods which they had got in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, even Jacob and all his seed: 

<sup>7</sup> His sons and his sons' sons, his daughters and his daughters' sons and all his family he took with him into Egypt. 

<sup>8</sup> And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt, even Jacob and all his sons: Reuben, Jacob's oldest son; 

<sup>9</sup> And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi; 

<sup>10</sup> And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul, the son of a woman of Canaan; 

<sup>11</sup> And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; 

<sup>12</sup> And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah: but Er and Onan had come to their death in the land of Canaan; and the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 

<sup>13</sup> And the sons of Issachar: Tola and Puah and Job and Shimron; 

<sup>14</sup> And the sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel; 

<sup>15</sup> All these, together with his daughter Dinah, were the children of Leah, whom Jacob had by her in Paddan-aram; they were thirty-three in number. 

<sup>16</sup> And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli; 

<sup>17</sup> And the sons of Asher: Jimnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah, and Sarah, their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 

<sup>18</sup> These are the children of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah, and Jacob had these sixteen children by her. 

<sup>19</sup> The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 

<sup>20</sup> And Joseph had Manasseh and Ephraim in the land of Egypt, by Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On. 

<sup>21</sup> And the sons of Benjamin were Belah and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard. 

<sup>22</sup> All these were the children of Rachel whom Jacob had by her, fourteen persons. 

<sup>23</sup> And the son of Dan was Hushim. 

<sup>24</sup> And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem. 

<sup>25</sup> These were the children of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, seven persons. 

<sup>26</sup> All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt, the offspring of his body, were sixty-six, without taking into account the wives of Jacob's sons. 

<sup>27</sup> And the sons of Joseph whom he had in Egypt were two. Seventy persons of the family of Jacob came into Egypt. 

<sup>28</sup> Now he had sent Judah before him to Goshen, to get word from Joseph; and so they came to the land of Goshen. 

<sup>29</sup> And Joseph got his carriage ready and went to Goshen for the meeting with his father; and when he came before him, he put his arms round his neck, weeping. 

<sup>30</sup> And Israel said to Joseph, Now that I have seen you living again, I am ready for death. 

<sup>31</sup> And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's people, I will go and give the news to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers and my father's people, from the land of Canaan, have come to me; 

<sup>32</sup> And these men are keepers of sheep and owners of cattle, and have with them their flocks and their herds and all they have. 

<sup>33</sup> Now when Pharaoh sends for you and says, What is your business? 

<sup>34</sup> You are to say, Your servants have been keepers of cattle from our early days up to now, like our fathers; in this way you will be able to have the land of Goshen for yourselves; because keepers of sheep are unclean in the eyes of the Egyptians.
