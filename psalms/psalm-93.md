# Psalm 93

<sup>1</sup> The Lord is King; he is clothed with glory; the Lord is clothed with strength; power is the cord of his robe; the world is fixed, so that it may not be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> The seat of your power has been from the past; you are eternal. 

<sup>3</sup> The rivers send up, O Lord, the rivers send up their voices; they send them up with a loud cry. 

<sup>4</sup> The Lord in heaven is stronger than the noise of great waters, yes, he is stronger than the great waves of the sea. 

<sup>5</sup> Your witness is most certain; it is right for your house to be holy, O Lord, for ever.
