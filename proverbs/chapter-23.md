# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> When you take your seat at the feast with a ruler, give thought with care to what is before you;

<sup>2</sup> And put a knife to your throat, if you have a strong desire for food.

<sup>3</sup> Have no desire for his delicate food, for it is the bread of deceit.

<sup>4</sup> Take no care to get wealth; let there be an end to your desire for money.

<sup>5</sup> Are your eyes lifted up to it? it is gone: for wealth takes to itself wings, like an eagle in flight up to heaven.

<sup>6</sup> Do not take the food of him who has an evil eye, or have any desire for his delicate meat:

<sup>7</sup> For as the thoughts of his heart are, so is he: Take food and drink, he says to you; but his heart is not with you.

<sup>8</sup> The food which you have taken will come up again, and your pleasing words will be wasted.

<sup>9</sup> Say nothing in the hearing of a foolish man, for he will put no value on the wisdom of your words.

<sup>10</sup> Do not let the landmark of the widow be moved, and do not go into the fields of those who have no father;

<sup>11</sup> For their saviour is strong, and he will take up their cause against you.

<sup>12</sup> Give your heart to teaching, and your ears to the words of knowledge.

<sup>13</sup> Do not keep back training from the child: for even if you give him blows with the rod, it will not be death to him.

<sup>14</sup> Give him blows with the rod, and keep his soul safe from the underworld.

<sup>15</sup> My son, if your heart becomes wise, I, even I, will be glad in heart;

<sup>16</sup> And my thoughts in me will be full of joy when your lips say right things.

<sup>17</sup> Have no envy of sinners in your heart, but keep in the fear of the Lord all through the day;

<sup>18</sup> For without doubt there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.

<sup>19</sup> Give ear, my son, and be wise, guiding your heart in the right way.

<sup>20</sup> Do not be among those who give themselves to wine-drinking, or among those who make themselves full with meat:

<sup>21</sup> For those who take delight in drink and feasting will come to be in need; and through love of sleep a man will be poorly clothed.

<sup>22</sup> Give ear to your father whose child you are, and do not keep honour from your mother when she is old.

<sup>23</sup> Get for yourself that which is true, and do not let it go for money; get wisdom and teaching and good sense.

<sup>24</sup> The father of the upright man will be glad, and he who has a wise child will have joy because of him.

<sup>25</sup> Let your father and your mother be glad, let her who gave you birth have joy.

<sup>26</sup> My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes take delight in my ways.

<sup>27</sup> For a loose woman is a deep hollow, and a strange woman is a narrow water-hole.

<sup>28</sup> Yes, she is waiting secretly like a beast for its food, and deceit by her is increased among men.

<sup>29</sup> Who says, Oh! who says, Ah! who has violent arguments, who has grief, who has wounds without cause, whose eyes are dark?

<sup>30</sup> Those who are seated late over the wine: those who go looking for mixed wine.

<sup>31</sup> Keep your eyes from looking on the wine when it is red, when its colour is bright in the cup, when it goes smoothly down:

<sup>32</sup> In the end, its bite is like that of a snake, its wound like the wound of a poison-snake.

<sup>33</sup> Your eyes will see strange things, and you will say twisted things.

<sup>34</sup> Yes, you will be like him who takes his rest on the sea, or on the top of a sail-support.

<sup>35</sup> They have overcome me, you will say, and I have no pain; they gave me blows without my feeling them: when will I be awake from my wine? I will go after it again.
