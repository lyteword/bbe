# Psalm 70 

To the chief music-maker. Of David. To keep in memory.

**¹** Let your salvation come quickly, O God; come quickly to my help, O Lord.

**²** Let those who go after my soul have shame and trouble; let those who have evil designs against me be turned back and made foolish.

**³** Let those who say Aha, aha! be turned back as a reward of their shame.

**⁴** Let all those who are looking for you be glad and have joy in you; let the lovers of your salvation ever say, May God be great.

**⁵** But I am poor and in need; come to me quickly, O God; you are my help and my saviour; let there be no waiting, O Lord.
