# Psalm 114 

**¹** When Israel came out of Egypt, the children of Jacob from a people whose language was strange to them;

**²** Judah became his holy place, and Israel his kingdom.

**³** The sea saw it, and went in flight; Jordan was turned back.

**⁴** The mountains were jumping like goats, and the little hills like lambs.

**⁵** What was wrong with you, O sea, that you went in flight? O Jordan, that you were turned back?

**⁶** You mountains, why were you jumping like goats, and you little hills like lambs?

**⁷** Be troubled, O earth, before the Lord, before the God of Jacob;

**⁸** Who made the rock into a water-spring, and the hard stone into a fountain.
