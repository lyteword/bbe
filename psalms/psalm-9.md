# Psalm 9

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker on Muthlabben. A Psalm. Of David. I will give you praise, O Lord, with all my heart; I will make clear all the wonder of your works. 

<sup>2</sup> I will be glad and have delight in you: I will make a song of praise to your name, O Most High. 

<sup>3</sup> When my haters are turned back, they will be broken and overcome before you. 

<sup>4</sup> For you gave approval to my right and my cause; you were seated in your high place judging in righteousness. 

<sup>5</sup> You have said sharp words to the nations, you have sent destruction on the sinners, you have put an end to their name for ever and ever. 

<sup>6</sup> You have given their towns to destruction; the memory of them has gone; they have become waste for ever. 

<sup>7</sup> But the Lord is King for ever: he has made ready his high seat for judging. 

<sup>8</sup> And he will be the judge of the world in righteousness, giving true decisions for the peoples. 

<sup>9</sup> The Lord will be a high tower for those who are crushed down, a high tower in times of trouble; 

<sup>10</sup> And those who have knowledge of your name will put their faith in you; because you, Lord, have ever given your help to those who were waiting for you. 

<sup>11</sup> Make songs of praise to the Lord, whose house is in Zion: make his doings clear to the people. 

<sup>12</sup> When he makes search for blood, he has them in his memory: he is not without thought for the cry of the poor. 

<sup>13</sup> Have mercy on me, O Lord, and see how I am troubled by my haters; let me be lifted up from the doors of death; 

<sup>14</sup> So that I may make clear all your praise in the house of the daughter of Zion: I will be glad because of your salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> The nations have gone down into the hole which they made: in their secret net is their foot taken. 

<sup>16</sup> The Lord has given knowledge of himself through his judging: the evil-doer is taken in the net which his hands had made. (Higgaion. Selah.) 

<sup>17</sup> The sinners and all the nations who have no memory of God will be turned into the underworld. 

<sup>18</sup> For the poor will not be without help; the hopes of those in need will not be crushed for ever. 

<sup>19</sup> Up! O Lord; let not man overcome you: let the nations be judged before you. 

<sup>20</sup> Put them in fear, O Lord, so that the nations may see that they are only men. (Selah.)
