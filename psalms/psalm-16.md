# Psalm 16

<sup>1</sup> Michtam. Of David. Keep me safe, O God: for in you I have put my faith. 

<sup>2</sup> O my soul, you have said to the Lord, You are my Lord: I have no good but you. 

<sup>3</sup> As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the noble in whom is all my delight. 

<sup>4</sup> Their sorrows will be increased who go after another god: I will not take drink offerings from their hands, or take their names on my lips. 

<sup>5</sup> The Lord is my heritage and the wine of my cup; you are the supporter of my right. 

<sup>6</sup> Fair are the places marked out for me; I have a noble heritage. 

<sup>7</sup> I will give praise to the Lord who has been my guide; knowledge comes to me from my thoughts in the night. 

<sup>8</sup> I have put the Lord before me at all times; because he is at my right hand, I will not be moved. 

<sup>9</sup> Because of this my heart is glad, and my glory is full of joy: while my flesh takes its rest in hope. 

<sup>10</sup> For you will not let my soul be prisoned in the underworld; you will not let your loved one see the place of death. 

<sup>11</sup> You will make clear to me the way of life; where you are joy is complete; in your right hand there are pleasures for ever and ever.
