# Psalm 64

To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.

**¹** O God, let the voice of my grief come to your ear: keep my life from the fear of those who are against me.

**²** Keep me safe from the secret purpose of wrongdoers; from the band of the workers of evil;

**³** Who make their tongues sharp like a sword, and whose arrows are pointed, even bitter words;

**⁴** So that in secret they may let loose their arrows at the upright, suddenly and unseen.

**⁵** They make themselves strong in an evil purpose; they make holes for secret nets; they say, Who will see it,

**⁶** Or make discovery of our secret purpose? The design is framed with care; and the inner thought of a man, and his heart, is deep.

**⁷** But God sends out an arrow against them; suddenly they are wounded.

**⁸** The evil of their tongues is the cause of their fall; all those who see them are shaking their heads at them.

**⁹** And in fear men make public the works of God; and giving thought to his acts they get wisdom.

**¹⁰** The upright will be glad in the Lord and have hope in him; and all the lovers of righteousness will give him glory.
