# Psalm 48 

A Song. A Psalm. Of the sons of Korah.

**¹** Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised, in the town of our God, in his holy mountain.

**²** Beautiful in its high position, the joy of all the earth, is the mountain of Zion, the mountain of God, the town of the great King.

**³** In its buildings God is seen to be a high tower.

**⁴** For see! the kings came together by agreement, they were joined together.

**⁵** They saw it, and so were full of wonder; they were troubled, and went quickly away in fear.

**⁶** Shaking came on them and pain, as on a woman in childbirth.

**⁷** By you the ships of Tarshish are broken as by an east wind.

**⁸** As it came to our ears so have we seen it, in the town of the Lord of armies, in the town of our God; God will keep it fixed for ever. (Selah.)

**⁹** Our thoughts were of your mercy, O God, while we were in your Temple.

**¹⁰** As your name is, O God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth; your right hand is full of righteousness.

**¹¹** Let there be joy in the mountain of Zion, and let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of your wise decisions.

**¹²** Make your way about Zion, and go round it, numbering its towers.

**¹³** Take note of its strong walls, looking well at its fair buildings; so that you may give word of it to the generation which comes after.

**¹⁴** Because this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide.
