# Psalm 62

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. After Jeduthun. A Psalm. Of David. My soul, put all your faith in God; for from him comes my salvation. 

<sup>2</sup> He only is my Rock and my salvation; he is my high tower; I will not be greatly moved. 

<sup>3</sup> How long will you go on designing evil against a man? running against him as against a broken wall, which is on the point of falling? 

<sup>4</sup> Their only thought is to put him down from his place of honour; their delight is in deceit: blessing is in their mouths but cursing in their hearts. (Selah.) 

<sup>5</sup> My soul, put all your faith in God; for from him comes my hope. 

<sup>6</sup> He only is my Rock and my salvation; he is my high tower; I will not be greatly moved. 

<sup>7</sup> In God is my salvation, and my glory; the Rock of my strength, and my safe place. 

<sup>8</sup> Have faith in him at all times, you people; let your hearts go flowing out before him: God is our safe place. (Selah.) 

<sup>9</sup> Truly men of low birth are nothing, and men of high position are not what they seem; if they are put in the scales together they are less than a breath. 

<sup>10</sup> Have no faith in the rewards of evil-doing, or in profits wrongly made: if your wealth is increased, do not put your hopes on it. 

<sup>11</sup> Once has God said, twice has it come to my ears, that power is God's: 

<sup>12</sup> And mercy, O Lord, is yours, for you give to every man the reward of his work.
