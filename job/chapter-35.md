# Chapter 35

<sup>1</sup> And Elihu made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Does it seem to you to be right, and righteousness before God, to say, 

<sup>3</sup> What profit is it to me, and how am I better off than if I had done wrong? 

<sup>4</sup> I will make answer to you and to your friends: 

<sup>5</sup> Let your eyes be turned to the heavens, and lifted up to see the skies; they are higher than you. 

<sup>6</sup> If you have done wrong, is he any the worse for it? and if your sins are great in number, what is it to him? 

<sup>7</sup> If you are upright, what do you give to him? or what does he take from your hand? 

<sup>8</sup> Your evil-doing may have an effect on a man like yourself, or your righteousness on a son of man. 

<sup>9</sup> Because the hand of the cruel is hard on them, men are making sounds of grief; they are crying out for help because of the arm of the strong. 

<sup>10</sup> But no one has said, Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night; 

<sup>11</sup> Who gives us more knowledge than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the heaven? 

<sup>12</sup> There they are crying out because of the pride of the evil-doers, but he gives them no answer. 

<sup>13</sup> But God will not give ear to what is false, or the Ruler of all take note of it; 

<sup>14</sup> How much less when you say that you do not see him; that the cause is before him, and you are waiting for him. 

<sup>15</sup> And now ... ; 

<sup>16</sup> And Job's mouth is open wide to give out what is of no profit, increasing words without knowledge.
