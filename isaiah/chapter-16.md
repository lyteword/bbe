# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> And they will send ... to the mountain of the daughter of Zion. 

<sup>2</sup> For the daughters of Moab will be like wandering birds, like a place from which the young birds have gone in flight, at the ways across the Arnon. 

<sup>3</sup> Give wise directions, make a decision; let your shade be as night in full day: keep safe those who are in flight; do not give up the wandering ones. 

<sup>4</sup> Let those who have been forced out of Moab have a resting-place with you; be a cover to them from him who is making waste their land: till the cruel ones are cut off, and wasting has come to an end, and those who take pleasure in crushing the poor are gone from the land. 

<sup>5</sup> Then a king's seat will be based on mercy, and one will be seated on it in the tent of David for ever; judging uprightly, and quick to do righteousness. 

<sup>6</sup> We have had word of the pride of Moab, how great it is; how he is lifted up in pride and passion: his high words about himself are false. 

<sup>7</sup> For this cause everyone in Moab will give cries of grief for Moab: crushed to the earth, they will be weeping for the men of Kir-hareseth. 

<sup>8</sup> For the fields of Heshbon are waste, the vine of Sibmah is dead; the lords of nations were overcome by the produce of her vines; her vine-plants went as far as Jazer, and came even to the waste land; her branches were stretched out to the sea. 

<sup>9</sup> For this cause my sorrow for the vine of Sibmah will be like the weeping for Jazer: my eyes are dropping water on you, O Heshbon and Elealeh! For they are sounding the war-cry over your summer fruits and the getting in of your grain; 

<sup>10</sup> And all joy is gone; no longer are they glad for the fertile field; and in the vine-gardens there are no songs or sounds of joy: the crushing of grapes has come to an end, and its glad cry has been stopped. 

<sup>11</sup> For this cause the cords of my heart are sounding for Moab, and I am full of sorrow for Kir-heres. 

<sup>12</sup> And when Moab goes up to the high place, and makes prayer in the house of his god, it will have no effect. 

<sup>13</sup> This is the word which the Lord said about Moab in the past. 

<sup>14</sup> But now the Lord has said, In three years, the years of a servant working for payment, the glory of Moab, all that great people, will be turned to shame, and the rest of Moab will be very small and without honour.
