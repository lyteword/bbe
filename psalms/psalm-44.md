# Psalm 44 

To the chief music-maker. Of the sons of Korah Maschil.

**¹** It has come to our ears, O God, our fathers have given us the story, of the works which you did in their days, in the old times,

**²** Uprooting the nations with your hand, and planting our fathers in their place; cutting down the nations, but increasing the growth of your people.

**³** For they did not make the land theirs by their swords, and it was not their arms which kept them safe; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, because you had pleasure in them.

**⁴** You are my King and my God; ordering salvation for Jacob.

**⁵** Through you will we overcome our haters; by your name will they be crushed under our feet who are violent against us.

**⁶** I will not put faith in my bow, my sword will not be my salvation.

**⁷** But it is you who have been our saviour from those who were against us, and have put to shame those who had hate for us.

**⁸** Our pride is in God at all times, to his name we give praise for ever. (Selah.)

**⁹** But now you have sent us away from you, and put us to shame; you do not go out with our armies.

**¹⁰** Because of this we are turned back by the attacker: those who have hate for us take our goods for themselves.

**¹¹** You have made us like sheep which are taken for meat; we are put to flight among the nations.

**¹²** You let your people go for nothing; your wealth is not increased by their price.

**¹³** You have made us to be looked down on by our neighbours, we are laughed at and shamed by those who are round about us.

**¹⁴** Our name is a word of shame among the nations, a sign for the shaking of heads among the peoples.

**¹⁵** My downfall is ever before me, and I am covered with the shame of my face;

**¹⁶** Because of the voice of him who says sharp and bitter words; because of the hater and him who is the instrument of punishment.

**¹⁷** All this has come on us, but still we have kept you in our memory; and we have not been false to your word.

**¹⁸** Our hearts have not gone back, and our steps have not been turned out of your way;

**¹⁹** Though you have let us be crushed in the place of jackals, though we are covered with darkest shade.

**²⁰** If the name of our God has gone out of our minds, or if our hands have been stretched out to a strange god,

**²¹** Will not God make search for it? for he sees the secrets of the heart.

**²²** Truly, because of you we are put to death every day; we are numbered like sheep for destruction.

**²³** Why are you sleeping, O Lord? awake! and come to our help, do not give us up for ever.

**²⁴** Why is your face covered, and why do you give no thought to our trouble and our cruel fate?

**²⁵** For our souls are crushed down to the dust: our bodies are stretched out on the earth.

**²⁶** Up! and come to our help, and give us salvation because of your mercy.
