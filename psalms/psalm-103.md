# Psalm 103

Of David.

**¹** Give praise to the Lord, O my soul; let everything in me give praise to his holy name.

**²** Give praise to the Lord, O my soul; let not all his blessings go from your memory.

**³** He has forgiveness for all your sins; he takes away all your diseases;

**⁴** He keeps back your life from destruction, crowning you with mercy and grace.

**⁵** He makes your mouth full of good things, so that your strength is made new again like the eagle's.

**⁶** The Lord gives decisions in righteousness for all who are in trouble.

**⁷** He gave knowledge of his way to Moses, and made his acts clear to the children of Israel.

**⁸** The Lord is kind and full of pity, not quickly made angry, but ever ready to have mercy.

**⁹** His feeling will no longer be bitter; he will not keep his wrath for ever.

**¹⁰** He has not given us the punishment for our sins, or the reward of our wrongdoing.

**¹¹** For as the heaven is high over the earth, so great is his mercy to his worshippers.

**¹²** As far as the east is from the west, so far has he put our sins from us.

**¹³** As a father has pity on his children, so the Lord has pity on his worshippers.

**¹⁴** For he has knowledge of our feeble frame; he sees that we are only dust.

**¹⁵** As for man, his days are as grass: his beautiful growth is like the flower of the field.

**¹⁶** The wind goes over it and it is gone; and its place sees it no longer.

**¹⁷** But the mercy of the Lord is eternal for his worshippers, and their children's children will see his righteousness;

**¹⁸** If they keep his agreement, and have his laws in mind to do them.

**¹⁹** The Lord has made ready his high seat in the heavens; his kingdom is ruling over all.

**²⁰** Give praise to the Lord, you his angels, who are great in strength, doing his orders, and waiting for his voice.

**²¹** Give praise to the Lord, all you his armies; and you his servants who do his pleasure.

**²²** Give praise to the Lord, all his works, in all places under his rule: give praise to the Lord, O my soul.
