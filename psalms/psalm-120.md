# Psalm 120

A Song of the going up.

**¹** In my trouble my cry went up to the Lord, and he gave me an answer.

**²** O Lord, be the saviour of my soul from false lips, and from the tongue of deceit.

**³** What punishment will he give you? what more will he do to you, you false tongue?

**⁴** Sharp arrows of the strong, and burning fire.

**⁵** Sorrow is mine because I am strange in Meshech, and living in the tents of Kedar.

**⁶** My soul has long been living with the haters of peace.

**⁷** I am for peace: but when I say so, they are for war.
