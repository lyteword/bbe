# Psalm 82

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Of Asaph. God is in the meeting-place of God; he is judging among the gods. 

<sup>2</sup> How long will you go on judging falsely, having respect for the persons of evil-doers? (Selah.) 

<sup>3</sup> Give ear to the cause of the poor and the children without fathers; let those who are troubled and in need have their rights. 

<sup>4</sup> Be the saviour of the poor and those who have nothing: take them out of the hand of the evil-doers. 

<sup>5</sup> They have no knowledge or sense; they go about in the dark: all the bases of the earth are moved. 

<sup>6</sup> I said, You are gods; all of you are the sons of the Most High: 

<sup>7</sup> But you will come to death like men, falling like one of the rulers of the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> Up! O God, come as judge of the earth; for all the nations are your heritage.
