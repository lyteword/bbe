# Psalm 47 

To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of the sons of Korah.

**¹** O make a glad noise with your hands, all you peoples; letting your voices go up to God with joy.

**²** For the Lord Most High is to be feared; he is a great King over all the earth.

**³** He will put down the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet.

**⁴** He will give us our heritage, the glory of Jacob who is dear to him. (Selah.)

**⁵** God has gone up with a glad cry, the Lord with the sound of the horn.

**⁶** Give praises to God, make songs of praise; give praises to our King, make songs of praise.

**⁷** For God is the King of all the earth; make songs of praise with knowledge.

**⁸** God is the ruler over the nations; God is on the high seat of his holy rule.

**⁹** The rulers of the peoples have come together, with the people of the God of Abraham; because the powers of the earth are God's: he is lifted up on high.
