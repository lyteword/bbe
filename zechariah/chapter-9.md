# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> A word of the Lord: The Lord has come to the land of Hadrach, and Damascus is his resting-place: for the towns of Aram are the Lord's, 

<sup>2</sup> As well as Hamath, which is by its limit, and Tyre and Zidon, because they are very wise. 

<sup>3</sup> And Tyre made for herself a strong place, and got together silver like dust and the best gold like the earth of the streets. 

<sup>4</sup> See, the Lord will take away her heritage, overturning her power in the sea; and she will be burned up with fire. 

<sup>5</sup> Ashkelon will see it with fear, and Gaza, bent with pain; and Ekron, for her hope will be shamed: and the king will be cut off from Gaza, and Ashkelon will be unpeopled. 

<sup>6</sup> And a mixed people will be living in Ashdod, and I will have the pride of the Philistines cut off. 

<sup>7</sup> And I will take away his blood from his mouth, and his disgusting things from between his teeth; and some of his people will be kept for our God: and he will be as a family in Judah, and Ekron as one living in Jerusalem. 

<sup>8</sup> And I will put my forces in position round my house, so that there may be no coming and going: and no cruel master will again go through them: for now I have seen his trouble. 

<sup>9</sup> Be full of joy, O daughter of Zion; give a glad cry, O daughter of Jerusalem: see, your king comes to you: he is upright and has overcome; gentle and seated on an ass, on a young ass. 

<sup>10</sup> And he will have the war-carriage cut off from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war will be cut off: and he will say words of peace to the nations: and his rule will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> And as for you, because of the blood of your agreement, I have sent out your prisoners from the deep hole in which there is no water. 

<sup>12</sup> And they will come back to you, O daughter of Zion, as prisoners of hope: today I say to you that I will give you back twice as much; 

<sup>13</sup> For I have made Judah a bow bent for my use, I have made Ephraim the arrows of the bow; I will make your sons, O Zion, take up arms against your sons, O Greece, and will make you like the sword of a man of war. 

<sup>14</sup> And the Lord will be seen over them, and his arrow will go out like the thunder-flame: and the Lord God, sounding the war-horn, will go in the storm-winds of the South. 

<sup>15</sup> The Lord of armies will be a cover for them; and they will overcome, crushing under foot the armed men; they will take their blood for drink like wine: they will be full like the sides of the altar. 

<sup>16</sup> And the Lord their God will be their saviour in that day, giving them food like the flock of his people: for they will be like the jewels of a crown shining over his land. 

<sup>17</sup> For how good it is and how beautiful! grain will make the young men strong and new wine the virgins.
