# Proverbs 20 

**¹** Wine makes men foolish, and strong drink makes men come to blows; and whoever comes into error through these is not wise.

**²** The wrath of a king is like the loud cry of a lion: he who makes him angry does wrong against himself.

**³** It is an honour for a man to keep from fighting, but the foolish are ever at war.

**⁴** The hater of work will not do his ploughing because of the winter; so at the time of grain-cutting he will be requesting food and will get nothing.

**⁵** The purpose in the heart of a man is like deep water, but a man of good sense will get it out.

**⁶** Most men make no secret of their kind acts: but where is a man of good faith to be seen?

**⁷** An upright man goes on in his righteousness: happy are his children after him!

**⁸** A king on the seat of judging puts to flight all evil with his eyes.

**⁹** Who is able to say, I have made my heart clean, I am free from my sin?

**¹⁰** Unequal weights and unequal measures, they are all disgusting to the Lord.

**¹¹** Even a child may be judged by his doings, if his work is free from sin and if it is right.

**¹²** The hearing ear and the seeing eye are equally the Lord's work.

**¹³** Do not be a lover of sleep, or you will become poor: keep your eyes open, and you will have bread enough.

**¹⁴** A poor thing, a poor thing, says he who is giving money for goods: but when he has gone on his way, then he makes clear his pride in what he has got.

**¹⁵** There is gold and a store of corals: but the lips of knowledge are a jewel of great price.

**¹⁶** Take a man's clothing if he makes himself responsible for a strange man, and get an undertaking from him who gives his word for strange men.

**¹⁷** Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but after, his mouth will be full of sand.

**¹⁸** Every purpose is put into effect by wise help: and by wise guiding make war.

**¹⁹** He who goes about talking of the business of others gives away secrets: so have nothing to do with him whose lips are open wide.

**²⁰** If anyone puts a curse on his father or his mother, his light will be put out in the blackest night.

**²¹** A heritage may be got quickly at first, but the end of it will not be a blessing.

**²²** Do not say, I will give punishment for evil: go on waiting for the Lord, and he will be your saviour.

**²³** Unequal weights are disgusting to the Lord, and false scales are not good.

**²⁴** A man's steps are of the Lord; how then may a man have knowledge of his way?

**²⁵** It is a danger to a man to say without thought, It is holy, and, after taking his oaths, to be questioning if it is necessary to keep them.

**²⁶** A wise king puts evil-doers to flight, and makes their evil-doing come back on them.

**²⁷** The Lord keeps watch over the spirit of man, searching all the deepest parts of the body.

**²⁸** Mercy and good faith keep the king safe, and the seat of his power is based on upright acts.

**²⁹** The glory of young men is their strength, and the honour of old men is their grey hairs.

**³⁰** By the wounds of the rod evil is taken away, and blows make clean the deepest parts of the body.
