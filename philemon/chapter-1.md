# Philemon 1 

**¹** Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith,

**²** And to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our brother in God's army, and to the church in your house:

**³** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**⁴** I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you,

**⁵** Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints;

**⁶** That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good thing in you, for Christ.

**⁷** For I had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you, brother.

**⁸** And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right,

**⁹** Still, because of love, in place of an order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus:

**¹⁰** My request is for my child Onesimus, the child of my chains,

**¹¹** Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me:

**¹²** Whom I have sent back to you, him who is my very heart:

**¹³** Though my desire was to keep him with me, to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place:

**¹⁴** But without your approval I would do nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely from your heart.

**¹⁵** For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever;

**¹⁶** No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in the flesh as well as in the Lord.

**¹⁷** If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself.

**¹⁸** If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything, put it to my account.

**¹⁹** I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life.

**²⁰** So brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ.

**²¹** Being certain that you will do my desire, I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say.

**²²** And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you.

**²³** Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his love;

**²⁴** And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my brother-workers.

**²⁵** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it.
