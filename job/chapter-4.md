# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> If one says a word, will it be a weariness to you? but who is able to keep from saying what is in his mind? 

<sup>3</sup> Truly, you have been a helper to others, and you have made feeble hands strong; 

<sup>4</sup> He who was near to falling has been lifted up by your words, and you have given strength to bent knees. 

<sup>5</sup> But now it has come on you and it is a weariness to you; you are touched by it and your mind is troubled. 

<sup>6</sup> Is not your fear of God your support, and your upright way of life your hope? 

<sup>7</sup> Have you ever seen destruction come to an upright man? or when were the god-fearing ever cut off? 

<sup>8</sup> What I have seen is that those by whom trouble has been ploughed, and evil planted, get the same for themselves. 

<sup>9</sup> By the breath of God destruction takes them, and by the wind of his wrath they are cut off. 

<sup>10</sup> Though the noise of the lion and the sounding of his voice, may be loud, the teeth of the young lions are broken. 

<sup>11</sup> The old lion comes to his end for need of food, and the young of the she-lion go wandering in all directions. 

<sup>12</sup> A word was given to me secretly, and the low sound of it came to my ears. 

<sup>13</sup> In troubled thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep comes on men, 

<sup>14</sup> Fear came on me and shaking, and my bones were full of trouble; 

<sup>15</sup> And a breath was moving over my face; the hair of my flesh became stiff: 

<sup>16</sup> Something was present before me, but I was not able to see it clearly; there was a form before my eyes: a quiet voice came to my ears, saying: 

<sup>17</sup> May a man be upright before God? or a man be clean before his Maker? 

<sup>18</sup> Truly, he puts no faith in his servants, and he sees error in his angels; 

<sup>19</sup> How much more those living in houses of earth, whose bases are in the dust! They are crushed more quickly than an insect; 

<sup>20</sup> Between morning and evening they are completely broken; they come to an end for ever, and no one takes note. 

<sup>21</sup> If their tent-cord is pulled up, do they not come to an end, and without wisdom?
