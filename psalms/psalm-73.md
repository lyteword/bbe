# Psalm 73

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Of Asaph. Truly, God is good to Israel, even to such as are clean in heart. 

<sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet had almost gone from under me; I was near to slipping; 

<sup>3</sup> Because of my envy of the men of pride, when I saw the well-being of the wrongdoers. 

<sup>4</sup> For they have no pain; their bodies are fat and strong. 

<sup>5</sup> They are not in trouble as others are; they have no part in the unhappy fate of men. 

<sup>6</sup> For this reason pride is round them like a chain; they are clothed with violent behaviour as with a robe. 

<sup>7</sup> Their eyes are bursting with fat; they have more than their heart's desire. 

<sup>8</sup> Their thoughts are deep with evil designs; their talk from their seats of power is of cruel acts. 

<sup>9</sup> Their mouth goes up to heaven; their tongues go walking through the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> For this reason they are full of bread; and water is ever flowing for them. 

<sup>11</sup> And they say, How will the Lord see this? is there knowledge in the Most High? 

<sup>12</sup> Truly, such are the sinners; they do well at all times, and their wealth is increased. 

<sup>13</sup> As for me, I have made my heart clean to no purpose, washing my hands in righteousness; 

<sup>14</sup> For I have been troubled all the day; every morning have I undergone punishment. 

<sup>15</sup> If I would make clear what it is like, I would say, You are false to the generation of your children. 

<sup>16</sup> When my thoughts were turned to see the reason of this, it was a weariness in my eyes; 

<sup>17</sup> Till I went into God's holy place, and saw the end of the evil-doers. 

<sup>18</sup> You put their feet where there was danger of slipping, so that they go down into destruction. 

<sup>19</sup> How suddenly are they wasted! fears are the cause of their destruction. 

<sup>20</sup> As a dream when one is awake, they are ended; they are like an image gone out of mind when sleep is over. 

<sup>21</sup> My heart was made bitter, and I was pained by the bite of grief: 

<sup>22</sup> As for me, I was foolish, and without knowledge; I was like a beast before you. 

<sup>23</sup> But still I am ever with you; you have taken me by my right hand. 

<sup>24</sup> Your wisdom will be my guide, and later you will put me in a place of honour. 

<sup>25</sup> Whom have I in heaven but you? and having you I have no desire for anything on earth. 

<sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart are wasting away: but God is the Rock of my heart and my eternal heritage. 

<sup>27</sup> For those who are far away from you will come to destruction: you will put an end to all those who have not kept faith with you. 

<sup>28</sup> But it is good for me to come near to God: I have put my faith in the Lord God, so that I may make clear all his works.
