# Matthew 1 

**¹** The book of the generations of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

**²** The son of Abraham was Isaac; and the son of Isaac was Jacob; and the sons of Jacob were Judah and his brothers;

**³** And the sons of Judah were Perez and Zerah by Tamar; and the son of Perez was Hezron; and the son of Hezron was Ram;

**⁴** And the son of Ram was Amminadab; and the son of Amminadab was Nahshon; and the son of Nahshon was Salmon;

**⁵** And the son of Salmon by Rahab was Boaz; and the son of Boaz by Ruth was Obed; and the son of Obed was Jesse;

**⁶** And the son of Jesse was David the king; and the son of David was Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah;

**⁷** And the son of Solomon was Rehoboam; and the son of Rehoboam was Abijah; and the son of Abijah was Asa;

**⁸** And the son of Asa was Jehoshaphat; and the son of Jehoshaphat was Joram; and the son of Joram was Uzziah;

**⁹** And the son of Uzziah was Jotham; and the son of Jotham was Ahaz; and the son of Ahaz was Hezekiah;

**¹⁰** And the son of Hezekiah was Manasseh; and the son of Manasseh was Amon; and the son of Amon was Josiah;

**¹¹** And the sons of Josiah were Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the taking away to Babylon.

**¹²** And after the taking away to Babylon, Jechoniah had a son Shealtiel; and Shealtiel had Zerubbabel;

**¹³** And Zerubbabel had Abiud; and Abiud had Eliakim; and Eliakim had Azor;

**¹⁴** And Azor had Zadok; and Zadok had Achim; and Achim had Eliud;

**¹⁵** And Eliud had Eleazar; and Eleazar had Matthan; and Matthan had Jacob;

**¹⁶** And the son of Jacob was Joseph the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, whose name is Christ.

**¹⁷** So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the taking away to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the taking away to Babylon to the coming of Christ, fourteen generations.

**¹⁸** Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way: when his mother Mary was going to be married to Joseph, before they came together the discovery was made that she was with child by the Holy Spirit.

**¹⁹** And Joseph, her husband, being an upright man, and not desiring to make her a public example, had a mind to put her away privately.

**²⁰** But when he was giving thought to these things, an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, have no fear of taking Mary as your wife; because that which is in her body is of the Holy Spirit.

**²¹** And she will give birth to a son; and you will give him the name Jesus; for he will give his people salvation from their sins.

**²²** Now all this took place so that the word of the Lord by the prophet might come true,

**²³** See, the virgin will be with child, and will give birth to a son, and they will give him the name Immanuel, that is, God with us.

**²⁴** And Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had said to him, and took her as his wife;

**²⁵** And he had no connection with her till she had given birth to a son; and he gave him the name Jesus.
