# Psalm 150

<sup>1</sup> Let the Lord be praised. Give praise to God in his holy place: give him praise in the heaven of his power. 

<sup>2</sup> Give him praise for his acts of power: give him praise in the measure of his great strength. 

<sup>3</sup> Give him praise with the sound of the horn: give him praise with corded instruments of music. 

<sup>4</sup> Give him praise with instruments of brass and in the dance: give him praise with horns and corded instruments. 

<sup>5</sup> Give him praise with the loud brass: give him praise with the high-sounding brass. 

<sup>6</sup> Let everything which has breath give praise to the Lord. Let the Lord be praised.
