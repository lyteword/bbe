# Psalm 22

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker on Aijeleth-hash-shahar. A Psalm. Of David. My God, my God, why are you turned away from me? why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my crying? 

<sup>2</sup> O my God, I make my cry in the day, and you give no answer; and in the night, and have no rest. 

<sup>3</sup> But you are holy, O you who are seated among the praises of Israel. 

<sup>4</sup> Our fathers had faith in you: they had faith and you were their saviour. 

<sup>5</sup> They sent up their cry to you and were made free: they put their faith in you and were not put to shame. 

<sup>6</sup> But I am a worm and not a man; cursed by men, and looked down on by the people. 

<sup>7</sup> I am laughed at by all those who see me: pushing out their lips and shaking their heads they say, 

<sup>8</sup> He put his faith in the Lord; let the Lord be his saviour now: let the Lord be his saviour, because he had delight in him. 

<sup>9</sup> But it was you who took care of me from the day of my birth: you gave me faith even from my mother's breasts. 

<sup>10</sup> I was in your hands even before my birth; you are my God from the time when I was in my mother's body. 

<sup>11</sup> Be not far from me, for trouble is near; there is no one to give help. 

<sup>12</sup> A great herd of oxen is round me: I am shut in by the strong oxen of Bashan. 

<sup>13</sup> I saw their mouths wide open, like lions crying after food. 

<sup>14</sup> I am flowing away like water, and all my bones are out of place: my heart is like wax, it has become soft in my body. 

<sup>15</sup> My throat is dry like a broken vessel; my tongue is fixed to the roof of my mouth, and the dust of death is on my lips. 

<sup>16</sup> Dogs have come round me: I am shut in by the band of evil-doers; they made wounds in my hands and feet. 

<sup>17</sup> I am able to see all my bones; their looks are fixed on me: 

<sup>18</sup> They make a division of my robes among them, by the decision of chance they take my clothing. 

<sup>19</sup> Do not be far from me, O Lord: O my strength, come quickly to my help. 

<sup>20</sup> Make my soul safe from the sword, my life from the power of the dog. 

<sup>21</sup> Be my saviour from the lion's mouth; let me go free from the horns of the cruel oxen. 

<sup>22</sup> I will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers: I will give you praise among the people. 

<sup>23</sup> You who have fear of the Lord, give him praise; all you seed of Jacob, give him glory; go in fear of him, all you seed of Israel. 

<sup>24</sup> For he has not been unmoved by the pain of him who is troubled; or kept his face covered from him; but he has given an answer to his cry. 

<sup>25</sup> My praise will be of you in the great meeting: I will make my offerings before his worshippers. 

<sup>26</sup> The poor will have a feast of good things: those who make search for the Lord will give him praise: your heart will have life for ever. 

<sup>27</sup> All the ends of the earth will keep it in mind and be turned to the Lord: all the families of the nations will give him worship. 

<sup>28</sup> For the kingdom is the Lord's; he is the ruler among the nations. 

<sup>29</sup> All the fat ones of the earth will give him worship; all those who go down to the dust will make themselves low before him, even he who has not enough for the life of his soul. 

<sup>30</sup> A seed will be his servant; the doings of the Lord will be made clear to the generation which comes after. 

<sup>31</sup> They will come and make his righteousness clear to a people of the future because he has done this.
