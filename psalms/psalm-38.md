# Psalm 38

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Of David. To keep in memory. O Lord, be not bitter with me in your wrath; let not your hand be on me in the heat of your passion. 

<sup>2</sup> For your arrows have gone into my flesh, and I am crushed under the weight of your hand. 

<sup>3</sup> My flesh is wasted because of your wrath; and there is no peace in my bones because of my sin. 

<sup>4</sup> For my crimes have gone over my head; they are like a great weight which is more than my strength. 

<sup>5</sup> My wounds are poisoned and evil-smelling, because of my foolish behaviour. 

<sup>6</sup> I am troubled, I am made low; I go weeping all the day. 

<sup>7</sup> For my body is full of burning; all my flesh is unhealthy. 

<sup>8</sup> I am feeble and crushed down; I gave a cry like a lion because of the grief in my heart. 

<sup>9</sup> Lord, all my desire is before you; my sorrow is not kept secret from you. 

<sup>10</sup> My heart goes out in pain, my strength is wasting away; as for the light of my eyes, it is gone from me. 

<sup>11</sup> My lovers and my friends keep away from my disease; my relations keep far away. 

<sup>12</sup> Those who have a desire to take my life put nets for me; those who are designing my destruction say evil things against me, all the day their minds are full of deceit. 

<sup>13</sup> But I kept my ears shut like a man without hearing; like a man without a voice, never opening his mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> So I was like a man whose ears are shut, and in whose mouth there are no sharp words. 

<sup>15</sup> In you, O Lord, is my hope: you will give me an answer, O Lord, my God. 

<sup>16</sup> I said, Let them not be glad over me; when my foot is moved, let them not be lifted up with pride against me. 

<sup>17</sup> My feet are near to falling, and my sorrow is ever before me. 

<sup>18</sup> I will make clear my wrongdoing, with sorrow in my heart for my sin. 

<sup>19</sup> But they are strong who have hate for me without cause: those who are against me falsely are increased in numbers. 

<sup>20</sup> They give me back evil for good; they are my haters because I go after the thing which is right. 

<sup>21</sup> Do not give me up, O Lord; O my God, be near to me. 

<sup>22</sup> Come quickly to give me help, O Lord, my salvation.
