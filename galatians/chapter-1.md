# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, an Apostle (not from men, and not through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who made him come back from the dead), 

<sup>2</sup> And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia: 

<sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>4</sup> Who gave himself for our sins, so that he might make us free from this present evil world, after the purpose of our God and Father: 

<sup>5</sup> To whom be the glory for ever and ever. So be it. 

<sup>6</sup> I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ, to good news of a different sort; 

<sup>7</sup> Which is not another sort: only there are some who give you trouble, desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ. 

<sup>8</sup> But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you, let there be a curse on him. 

<sup>9</sup> As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you, let there be a curse on him. 

<sup>10</sup> Am I now using arguments to men, or God? or is it my desire to give men pleasure? if I was still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ. 

<sup>11</sup> Because I say to you, my brothers, that the good news of which I was the preacher is not man's. 

<sup>12</sup> For I did not get it from man, and I was not given teaching in it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews' religion, how I was cruel without measure to the church of God, and did great damage to it: 

<sup>14</sup> And I went farther in the Jews' religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen, having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers. 

<sup>15</sup> But when it was the good pleasure of God, by whom I was marked out even from my mother's body, through his grace, 

<sup>16</sup> To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood, 

<sup>17</sup> And I went not up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and again I came back to Damascus. 

<sup>18</sup> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and was there with him fifteen days. 

<sup>19</sup> But of the other Apostles I saw only James, the Lord's brother. 

<sup>20</sup> Now God is witness that the things which I am writing to you are true. 

<sup>21</sup> Then I came to the parts of Syria and Cilicia. 

<sup>22</sup> And the churches of Judaea which were in Christ still had no knowledge of my face or person: 

<sup>23</sup> Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him; 

<sup>24</sup> And they gave glory to God in me.
