# Chapter 53

<sup>1</sup> Who would have had faith in the word which has come to our ears, and to whom had the arm of the Lord been unveiled? 

<sup>2</sup> For his growth was like that of a delicate plant before him, and like a root out of a dry place: he had no grace of form, to give us pleasure; 

<sup>3</sup> Men made sport of him, turning away from him; he was a man of sorrows, marked by disease; and like one from whom men's faces are turned away, he was looked down on, and we put no value on him. 

<sup>4</sup> But it was our pain he took, and our diseases were put on him: while to us he seemed as one diseased, on whom God's punishment had come. 

<sup>5</sup> But it was for our sins he was wounded, and for our evil doings he was crushed: he took the punishment by which we have peace, and by his wounds we are made well. 

<sup>6</sup> We all went wandering like sheep; going every one of us after his desire; and the Lord put on him the punishment of us all. 

<sup>7</sup> Men were cruel to him, but he was gentle and quiet; as a lamb taken to its death, and as a sheep before those who take her wool makes no sound, so he said not a word. 

<sup>8</sup> They took away from him help and right, and who gave a thought to his fate? for he was cut off from the land of the living: he came to his death for the sin of my people. 

<sup>9</sup> And they put his body into the earth with sinners, and his last resting-place was with the evil-doers, though he had done no wrong, and no deceit was in his mouth. 

<sup>10</sup> And the Lord was pleased ... see a seed, long life, ... will do well in his hand. ... 

<sup>11</sup> ... made clear his righteousness before men ... had taken their sins on himself. 

<sup>12</sup> For this cause he will have a heritage with the great, and he will have a part in the goods of war with the strong, because he gave up his life, and was numbered with the evil-doers; taking on himself the sins of the people, and making prayer for the wrongdoers.
