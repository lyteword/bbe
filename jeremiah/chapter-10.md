# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Give ear to the word which the Lord says to you, O people of Israel: 

<sup>2</sup> This is what the Lord has said: Do not go in the way of the nations; have no fear of the signs of heaven, for the nations go in fear of them. 

<sup>3</sup> For that which is feared by the people is foolish: it is the work of the hands of the workman; for a tree is cut down by him out of the woods with his axe. 

<sup>4</sup> They make it beautiful with silver and gold; they make it strong with nails and hammers, so that it may not be moved. 

<sup>5</sup> It is like a pillar in a garden of plants, and has no voice: it has to be lifted, for it has no power of walking. Have no fear of it; for it has no power of doing evil and it is not able to do any good. 

<sup>6</sup> There is no one like you, O Lord; you are great and your name is great in power. 

<sup>7</sup> Who would not have fear of you, O King of the nations? for it is your right: for among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you. 

<sup>8</sup> But they are together like beasts and foolish: the teaching of false gods is wood. 

<sup>9</sup> Silver hammered into plates is sent from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the expert workman and of the hands of the gold-worker; blue and purple is their clothing, all the work of expert men. 

<sup>10</sup> But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God and an eternal king: when he is angry, the earth is shaking with fear, and the nations give way before his wrath. 

<sup>11</sup> This is what you are to say to them: The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth will be cut off from the earth and from under the heavens. 

<sup>12</sup> He has made the earth by his power, he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom, and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out. 

<sup>13</sup> At the sound of his voice there is a massing of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth; he makes the thunder-flames for the rain, and sends out the wind from his store-houses. 

<sup>14</sup> Then every man becomes like a beast without knowledge; every gold-worker is put to shame by the image he has made: for his metal image is deceit, and there is no breath in them. 

<sup>15</sup> They are nothing, a work of error: in the time of their punishment, destruction will overtake them. 

<sup>16</sup> The heritage of Jacob is not like these; for the maker of all things is his heritage: the Lord of armies is his name. 

<sup>17</sup> Get your goods together and go out of the land, O you who are shut up in the walled town. 

<sup>18</sup> For the Lord has said, I will send the people in flight like a stone from the land at this time, troubling them so that they will be conscious of it. 

<sup>19</sup> Sorrow is mine for I am wounded! my wound may not be made well; and I said, Cruel is my disease, I may not be free from it. 

<sup>20</sup> My tent is pulled down and all my cords are broken: my children have gone from me, and they are not: no longer is there anyone to give help in stretching out my tent and hanging up my curtains. 

<sup>21</sup> For the keepers of the sheep have become like beasts, not looking to the Lord for directions: so they have not done wisely and all their flocks have been put to flight. 

<sup>22</sup> News is going about, see, it is coming, a great shaking is coming from the north country, so that the towns of Judah may be made waste and become the living-place of jackals. 

<sup>23</sup> O Lord, I am conscious that a man's way is not in himself: man has no power of guiding his steps. 

<sup>24</sup> O Lord, put me right, but with wise purpose; not in your wrath, or you will make me small. 

<sup>25</sup> Let your wrath be let loose on the nations which have no knowledge of you, and on the families who give no worship to your name: for they have made a meal of Jacob, truly they have made a meal of him and put an end to him and made his fields a waste.
