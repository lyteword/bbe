# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> The designs of the heart are man's, but the answer of the tongue comes from the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> All a man's ways are clean to himself; but the Lord puts men's spirits into his scales. 

<sup>3</sup> Put your works into the hands of the Lord, and your purposes will be made certain. 

<sup>4</sup> The Lord has made everything for his purpose, even the sinner for the day of evil. 

<sup>5</sup> Everyone who has pride in his heart is disgusting to the Lord: he will certainly not go free from punishment. 

<sup>6</sup> By mercy and good faith evil-doing is taken away: and by the fear of the Lord men are turned away from evil. 

<sup>7</sup> When a man's ways are pleasing to the Lord, he makes even his haters be at peace with him. 

<sup>8</sup> Better is a little with righteousness, than great wealth with wrongdoing. 

<sup>9</sup> A man may make designs for his way, but the Lord is the guide of his steps. 

<sup>10</sup> Decision is in the lips of the king: his mouth will not go wrong in judging. 

<sup>11</sup> True measures and scales are the Lord's: all the weights of the bag are his work. 

<sup>12</sup> Evil-doing is disgusting to kings: for the seat of the ruler is based on righteousness. 

<sup>13</sup> Lips of righteousness are the delight of kings; and he who says what is upright is dear to him. 

<sup>14</sup> The wrath of the king is like those who give news of death, but a wise man will put peace in place of it. 

<sup>15</sup> In the light of the king's face there is life; and his approval is like a cloud of spring rain. 

<sup>16</sup> How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! and to get knowledge is more to be desired than silver. 

<sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright is to be turned away from evil: he who takes care of his way will keep his soul. 

<sup>18</sup> Pride goes before destruction, and a stiff spirit before a fall. 

<sup>19</sup> Better it is to have a gentle spirit with the poor, than to take part in the rewards of war with men of pride. 

<sup>20</sup> He who gives attention to the law of right will get good; and whoever puts his faith in the Lord is happy. 

<sup>21</sup> The wise-hearted will be named men of good sense: and by pleasing words learning is increased. 

<sup>22</sup> Wisdom is a fountain of life to him who has it; but the punishment of the foolish is their foolish behaviour. 

<sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise man is the teacher of his mouth, and gives increased learning to his lips. 

<sup>24</sup> Pleasing words are like honey, sweet to the soul and new life to the bones. 

<sup>25</sup> There is a way which seems straight before a man, but its end is the ways of death. 

<sup>26</sup> The desire of the working man is working for him, for his need of food is driving him on. 

<sup>27</sup> A good-for-nothing man is a designer of evil, and in his lips there is a burning fire. 

<sup>28</sup> A man of twisted purposes is a cause of fighting everywhere: and he who says evil secretly makes trouble between friends. 

<sup>29</sup> A violent man puts desire of evil into his neighbour's mind, and makes him go in a way which is not good. 

<sup>30</sup> He whose eyes are shut is a man of twisted purposes, and he who keeps his lips shut tight makes evil come about. 

<sup>31</sup> The grey head is a crown of glory, if it is seen in the way of righteousness. 

<sup>32</sup> He who is slow to be angry is better than a man of war, and he who has control over his spirit than he who takes a town. 

<sup>33</sup> A thing may be put to the decision of chance, but it comes about through the Lord.
