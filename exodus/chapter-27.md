# Exodus 27 

**¹** And make an altar of hard wood, a square altar, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high.

**²** Put horns at the four angles of it, made of the same, plating it all with brass.

**³** And make all its vessels, the baskets for taking away the dust of the fire, the spades and basins and meat-hooks and fire-trays, of brass.

**⁴** And make a network of brass, with four brass rings at its four angles.

**⁵** And put the network under the shelf round the altar so that the net comes half-way up the altar.

**⁶** And make rods for the altar, of hard wood, plated with brass.

**⁷** And put the rods through the rings at the two opposite sides of the altar, for lifting it.

**⁸** The altar is to be hollow, boarded in with wood; make it from the design which you saw on the mountain.

**⁹** And let there be an open space round the House, with hangings for its south side of the best linen, a hundred cubits long.

**¹⁰** Their twenty pillars and their twenty bases are to be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their bands are to be of silver.

**¹¹** And on the north side in the same way, hangings a hundred cubits long, with twenty pillars of brass on bases of brass; their hooks and their bands are to be of silver.

**¹²** And for the open space on the west side, the hangings are to be fifty cubits wide, with ten pillars and ten bases;

**¹³** And on the east side the space is to be fifty cubits wide.

**¹⁴** On the one side of the doorway will be hangings fifteen cubits long, with three pillars and three bases;

**¹⁵** And on the other side, hangings fifteen cubits long, with three pillars and three bases.

**¹⁶** And across the doorway, a veil of twenty cubits of the best linen, made of needlework of blue and purple and red, with four pillars and four bases.

**¹⁷** All the pillars round the open space are to have silver bands, with hooks of silver and bases of brass.

**¹⁸** The open space is to be a hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, with sides five cubits high, curtained with the best linen, with bases of brass.

**¹⁹** All the instruments for the work of the House, and all its nails, and the nails of the open space are to be of brass.

**²⁰** Give orders to the children of Israel to give you clear olive oil for the lights, so that a light may be burning there at all times.

**²¹** Let Aaron and his sons put this in order, evening and morning, before the Lord, inside the Tent of meeting, outside the veil which is before the ark; this is to be an order for ever, from generation to generation, to be kept by the children of Israel.
