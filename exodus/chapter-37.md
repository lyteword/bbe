# Chapter 37

**¹** And Bezalel made the ark of hard wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit and a half high;

**²** Plating it inside and out with the best gold, and putting an edge of gold all round it.

**³** And he made four gold rings for its four angles, two on one side and two on the other,

**⁴** And rods of the same wood plated with gold.

**⁵** These rods he put in the rings at the sides of the ark, for lifting it.

**⁶** And he made the cover all of gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.

**⁷** And he made two winged ones, hammered out of one bit of gold, for the two ends of the cover;

**⁸** Placing one at one end and one at the other; the winged ones were part of the cover.

**⁹** And their wings were stretched out over the cover; the faces of the winged ones were opposite one another and facing the cover.

**¹⁰** And he made the table of hard wood, two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high;

**¹¹** Plating it with the best gold and putting a gold edge all round it.

**¹²** And he made a frame all round it about as wide as a man's hand, edged with gold all round.

**¹³** And he made four gold rings, and put the rings at the angles of its four feet.

**¹⁴** The rings were fixed under the frame to take the rods with which the table was to be lifted.

**¹⁵** The rods for lifting the table he made of hard wood plated with gold.

**¹⁶** And all the table-vessels, the plates and spoons and basins and the cups for liquids, he made of the best gold.

**¹⁷** Then he made the support for the lights, all of the best gold; its base and its pillar were of hammered gold; its cups and buds and flowers were all made out of the same metal:

**¹⁸** It had six branches coming out from its sides, three from one side and three from the other;

**¹⁹** Every branch having three cups made like almond flowers, every cup with a bud and a flower on all the branches;

**²⁰** And on its pillar, four cups like almond flowers, every one with its bud and its flower;

**²¹** And under every two branches a bud, made with the branch, for all six branches of it.

**²²** The buds and the branches were made of the same metal, all together one complete work of the best hammered gold.

**²³** And he made the seven vessels for the lights, and all the necessary instruments for it, of gold.

**²⁴** A talent of the best gold was used for the making of it and its vessels.

**²⁵** And he made the altar for the burning of spices, using the same hard wood; it was square, a cubit long and a cubit wide and two cubits high; the horns made of the same.

**²⁶** The top and the sides and the horns were all plated with the best gold; and he put an edge of gold all round it.

**²⁷** And he made two gold rings, placing them on the two opposite sides under the edge, to take the rods for lifting it.

**²⁸** The rods he made of the same hard wood, plating them with gold.

**²⁹** And he made the holy oil and the perfume of sweet spices for burning, after the art of the perfume-maker.
