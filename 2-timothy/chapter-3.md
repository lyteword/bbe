# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> But be certain of this, that in the last days times of trouble will come. 

<sup>2</sup> For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, uplifted in pride, given to bitter words, going against the authority of their fathers, never giving praise, having no religion, 

<sup>3</sup> Without natural love, bitter haters, saying evil of others, violent and uncontrolled, hating all good, 

<sup>4</sup> False to their friends, acting without thought, lifted up in mind, loving pleasure more than God; 

<sup>5</sup> Having a form of religion, but turning their backs on the power of it: go not with these. 

<sup>6</sup> For these are they who go secretly into houses, making prisoners of foolish women, weighted down with sin, turned from the way by their evil desires, 

<sup>7</sup> Ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge of what is true. 

<sup>8</sup> And as James and Jambres went against Moses, so do these go against what is true: men of evil minds, who, tested by faith, are seen to be false. 

<sup>9</sup> But they will go no farther: for their foolish behaviour will be clear to all men, as theirs was in the end. 

<sup>10</sup> But you took as your example my teaching, behaviour, purpose, and faith; my long waiting, my love, my quiet undergoing of trouble; 

<sup>11</sup> My punishments and pain; the things which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; the cruel attacks made on me: and the Lord made me free from them all. 

<sup>12</sup> Yes, and all whose purpose is to be living in the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, will be cruelly attacked. 

<sup>13</sup> Evil and false men will become worse and worse, using deceit and themselves overcome by deceit. 

<sup>14</sup> But see that you keep to the teaching you have been given and the things of which you are certain, conscious of who has been your teacher; 

<sup>15</sup> And that from the time when you were a child, you have had knowledge of the holy Writings, which are able to make you wise to salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>16</sup> Every holy Writing which comes from God is of profit for teaching, for training, for guiding, for education in righteousness: 

<sup>17</sup> So that the man of God may be complete, trained and made ready for every good work.
