# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> My desire is, first of all, that you will make requests and prayers and give praise for all men; 

<sup>2</sup> For kings and all those in authority; so that we may have a calm and quiet life in all fear of God and serious behaviour. 

<sup>3</sup> This is good and pleasing in the eyes of God our Saviour; 

<sup>4</sup> Whose desire is that all men may have salvation and come to the knowledge of what is true. 

<sup>5</sup> For there is one God and one peacemaker between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 

<sup>6</sup> Who gave himself as an offering for all; witness of which was to be given at the right time; 

<sup>7</sup> And of this I became a preacher and an Apostle (what I say is true, not false,) and a teacher of the Gentiles in the true faith. 

<sup>8</sup> It is my desire, then, that in every place men may give themselves to prayer, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or argument. 

<sup>9</sup> And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price; 

<sup>10</sup> But clothed with good works, as is right for women who are living in the fear of God. 

<sup>11</sup> Let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority. 

<sup>12</sup> In my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher, or to have rule over a man, but to be quiet. 

<sup>13</sup> For Adam was first formed, then Eve; 

<sup>14</sup> And Adam was not taken by deceit, but the woman, being tricked, became a wrongdoer. 

<sup>15</sup> But if they go on in faith and love and holy self-control, she will be kept safe at the time of childbirth.
