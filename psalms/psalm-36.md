# Psalm 36

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. Of the servant of the Lord. Of David. The sin of the evil-doer says in his heart, There is no fear of the Lord before his eyes. 

<sup>2</sup> For he takes comfort in the thought that his sin will not be uncovered and hated. 

<sup>3</sup> In the words of his mouth are evil and deceit; he has given up being wise and doing good. 

<sup>4</sup> He gives thought to evil on his bed; he takes a way which is not good; he is not a hater of evil. 

<sup>5</sup> Your mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and your strong purpose is as high as the clouds. 

<sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judging is like the great deep; O Lord, you give life to man and beast. 

<sup>7</sup> How good is your loving mercy, O God! the children of men take cover under the shade of your wings. 

<sup>8</sup> The delights of your house will be showered on them; you will give them drink from the river of your pleasures. 

<sup>9</sup> For with you is the fountain of life: in your light we will see light. 

<sup>10</sup> O let there be no end to your loving mercy to those who have knowledge of you, or of your righteousness to the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> Let not the foot of pride come against me, or the hand of the evil-doers put me out of my place. 

<sup>12</sup> There the workers of evil have come down: they have been made low, and will not be lifted up.
