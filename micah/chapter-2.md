# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> A curse on the designers of evil, working on their beds! in the morning light they do it, because it is in their power. 

<sup>2</sup> They have a desire for fields and take them by force; and for houses and take them away: they are cruel to a man and his family, even to a man and his heritage. 

<sup>3</sup> For this cause the Lord has said, See, against this family I am purposing an evil from which you will not be able to take your necks away, and you will be weighted down by it; for it is an evil time. 

<sup>4</sup> In that day this saying will be said about you, and this song of grief will be made: The heritage of my people is measured out, and there is no one to give it back; those who have made us prisoners have taken our fields from us, and complete destruction has come to us. 

<sup>5</sup> For this cause you will have no one to make the decision by the measuring line in the meeting of the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> Let not words like these be dropped, they say: Shame and the curse will not come to the family of Jacob! 

<sup>7</sup> Is the Lord quickly made angry? are these his doings? do not his words do good to his people Israel? 

<sup>8</sup> As for you, you have become haters of those who were at peace with you: you take the clothing of those who go by without fear, and make them prisoners of war. 

<sup>9</sup> The women of my people you have been driving away from their dearly loved children; from their young ones you are taking my glory for ever. 

<sup>10</sup> Up! and go; for this is not your rest: because it has been made unclean, the destruction ordered will come on you. 

<sup>11</sup> If a man came with a false spirit of deceit, saying, I will be a prophet to you of wine and strong drink: he would be the sort of prophet for this people. 

<sup>12</sup> I will certainly make all of you, O Jacob, come together; I will get together the rest of Israel; I will put them together like the sheep in their circle: like a flock in their green field; they will be full of the noise of men. 

<sup>13</sup> The opener of the way will go up before them: forcing their way out they will go on to the doorway and out through it: their king will go on before them, and the Lord at their head.
