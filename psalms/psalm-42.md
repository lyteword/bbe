# Psalm 42 

To the chief music-maker. Maschil. Of the sons of Korah.

**¹** Like the desire of the roe for the water-streams, so is my soul's desire for you, O God.

**²** My soul is dry for need of God, the living God; when may I come and see the face of God?

**³** My tears have been my food day and night, while they keep saying to me, Where is your God?

**⁴** Let my soul be overflowing with grief when these things come back to my mind, how I went in company to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with the song of those who were keeping the feast.

**⁵** Why are you crushed down, O my soul? and why are you troubled in me? put your hope in God; for I will again give him praise who is my help and my God.

**⁶** My soul is crushed down in me, so I will keep you in mind; from the land of Jordan and of the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.

**⁷** Deep is sounding to deep at the noise of your waterfalls; all your waves have gone rolling over me.

**⁸** But the Lord will send his mercy in the daytime, and in the night his song will be with me, a prayer to the God of my life.

**⁹** I will say to God my Rock, Why have you let me go from your memory? why do I go in sorrow because of the attacks of my haters?

**¹⁰** The cruel words of my haters are like a crushing of my bones; when they say to me every day, Where is your God?

**¹¹** Why are you crushed down, O my soul? and why are you troubled in me? put your hope in God; for I will again give him praise who is my help and my God.
