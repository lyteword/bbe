# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> Truly, my eye has seen all this, word of it has come to my ear, and I have knowledge of it. 

<sup>2</sup> The same things are in my mind as in yours; I am equal to you. 

<sup>3</sup> But I would have talk with the Ruler of all, and my desire is to have an argument with God. 

<sup>4</sup> But you put a false face on things; all your attempts to put things right are of no value. 

<sup>5</sup> If only you would keep quiet, it would be a sign of wisdom! 

<sup>6</sup> Give ear to the argument of my mouth, and take note of the words of my lips. 

<sup>7</sup> Will you say in God's name what is not right, and put false words into his mouth? 

<sup>8</sup> Will you have respect for God's person in this cause, and put yourselves forward as his supporters? 

<sup>9</sup> Will it be good for you to be searched out by him, or have you the thought that he may be guided into error like a man? 

<sup>10</sup> He will certainly put you right, if you have respect for persons in secret. 

<sup>11</sup> Will not his glory put you in fear, so that your hearts will be overcome before him? 

<sup>12</sup> Your wise sayings are only dust, and your strong places are only earth. 

<sup>13</sup> Keep quiet, and let me say what is in my mind, whatever may come to me. 

<sup>14</sup> I will take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand. 

<sup>15</sup> Truly, he will put an end to me; I have no hope; but I will not give way in argument before him; 

<sup>16</sup> And that will be my salvation, for an evil-doer would not come before him, 

<sup>17</sup> Give ear with care to my words, and keep what I say in your minds. 

<sup>18</sup> See now, I have put my cause in order, and I am certain that I will be seen to be right. 

<sup>19</sup> Is any one able to take up the argument against me? If so, I would keep quiet and give up my breath. 

<sup>20</sup> Only two things do not do to me, then I will come before your face: 

<sup>21</sup> Take your hand far away from me; and let me not be overcome by fear of you. 

<sup>22</sup> Then at the sound of your voice I will give answer; or let me put forward my cause for you to give me an answer. 

<sup>23</sup> What is the number of my evil-doings and my sins? give me knowledge of them. 

<sup>24</sup> Why is your face veiled from me, as if I was numbered among your haters? 

<sup>25</sup> Will you be hard on a leaf in flight before the wind? will you make a dry stem go more quickly on its way? 

<sup>26</sup> For you put bitter things on record against me, and send punishment on me for the sins of my early years; 

<sup>27</sup> And you put chains on my feet, watching all my ways, and making a limit for my steps; 

<sup>28</sup> Though a man comes to nothing like a bit of dead wood, or like a robe which has become food for the worm.
