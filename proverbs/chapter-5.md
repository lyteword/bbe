# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> My son, give attention to my wisdom; let your ear be turned to my teaching:

<sup>2</sup> So that you may be ruled by a wise purpose, and your lips may keep knowledge.

<sup>3</sup> For honey is dropping from the lips of the strange woman, and her mouth is smoother than oil;

<sup>4</sup> But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword;

<sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death, and her steps to the underworld;

<sup>6</sup> She never keeps her mind on the road of life; her ways are uncertain, she has no knowledge.

<sup>7</sup> Give ear to me then, my sons, and do not put away my words from you.

<sup>8</sup> Go far away from her, do not come near the door of her house;

<sup>9</sup> For fear that you may give your honour to others, and your wealth to strange men:

<sup>10</sup> And strange men may be full of your wealth, and the fruit of your work go to the house of others;

<sup>11</sup> And you will be full of grief at the end of your life, when your flesh and your body are wasted;

<sup>12</sup> And you will say, How was teaching hated by me, and my heart put no value on training;

<sup>13</sup> I did not give attention to the voice of my teachers, my ear was not turned to those who were guiding me!

<sup>14</sup> I was in almost all evil in the company of the people.

<sup>15</sup> Let water from your store and not that of others be your drink, and running water from your fountain.

<sup>16</sup> Let not your springs be flowing in the streets, or your streams of water in the open places.

<sup>17</sup> Let them be for yourself only, not for other men with you.

<sup>18</sup> Let blessing be on your fountain; have joy in the wife of your early years.

<sup>19</sup> As a loving hind and a gentle doe, let her breasts ever give you rapture; let your passion at all times be moved by her love.

<sup>20</sup> Why let yourself, my son, go out of the way with a strange woman, and take another woman in your arms?

<sup>21</sup> For a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and he puts all his goings in the scales.

<sup>22</sup> The evil-doer will be taken in the net of his crimes, and prisoned in the cords of his sin.

<sup>23</sup> He will come to his end for need of teaching; he is so foolish that he will go wandering from the right way.
