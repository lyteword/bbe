# Psalm 37

<sup>1</sup> Of David. Do not be angry because of the wrongdoers, or have envy of the workers of evil. 

<sup>2</sup> For they will quickly be cut down like grass, and become dry like the green plants. 

<sup>3</sup> Have faith in the Lord, and do good; be at rest in the land, and go after righteousness. 

<sup>4</sup> So will your delight be in the Lord, and he will give you your heart's desires. 

<sup>5</sup> Put your life in the hands of the Lord; have faith in him and he will do it. 

<sup>6</sup> And he will make your righteousness be seen like the light, and your cause like the shining of the sun. 

<sup>7</sup> Take your rest in the Lord, waiting quietly for him; do not be angry because of the man who does well in his evil ways, and gives effect to his bad designs. 

<sup>8</sup> Put an end to your wrath and be no longer bitter; do not give way to angry feeling which is a cause of sin. 

<sup>9</sup> For the evil-doers will be cut off: but those who have faith in the Lord will have the earth for their heritage. 

<sup>10</sup> For in a short time the evil-doer will be gone: you will go searching for his place, and it will not be there. 

<sup>11</sup> But the gentle will have the earth for their heritage; they will take their delight in peace without measure. 

<sup>12</sup> The sinner has evil designs against the upright, lifting up the voice of wrath against him. 

<sup>13</sup> He will be laughed at by the Lord, who sees that his day is coming. 

<sup>14</sup> The evil-doers have taken out their swords, their bows are bent; for crushing the poor, and to put to death those who are upright in their ways. 

<sup>15</sup> But their swords will be turned into their hearts, and their bows will be broken. 

<sup>16</sup> The little which the good man has is better than the wealth of evil-doers. 

<sup>17</sup> For the arms of the evil-doers will be broken: but the Lord is the support of the good. 

<sup>18</sup> The days of the upright are numbered by the Lord, and their heritage will be for ever. 

<sup>19</sup> They will not be shamed in the evil time, and in the days when all are in need of food they will have enough. 

<sup>20</sup> But the wrongdoers will come to destruction, and the haters of the Lord will be like the fat of lambs, they will be burned up; they will go up in smoke, and never again be seen. 

<sup>21</sup> The sinner takes money and does not give it back; but the upright man has mercy, and gives to others. 

<sup>22</sup> Those who have his blessing will have the earth for their heritage; but those who are cursed by him will be cut off. 

<sup>23</sup> The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he takes delight in his way. 

<sup>24</sup> Even if he has a fall he will not be without help: for the hand of the Lord is supporting him. 

<sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now am old, but I have not seen the good man without help, or his children looking for bread. 

<sup>26</sup> All the day he is ready to have mercy and to give; his children are a blessing. 

<sup>27</sup> Be turned from evil, and do good; and your place will be for ever. 

<sup>28</sup> For the Lord is a lover of righteousness, and takes care of his saints; they will be kept safe for ever; but the seed of the evil-doers will be cut off. 

<sup>29</sup> The upright will have the earth for their heritage, and will go on living there for ever. 

<sup>30</sup> The mouth of the good man says words of wisdom; the talk of his tongue is of righteousness. 

<sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart; he will never make a false step. 

<sup>32</sup> The sinners are watching the upright man, desiring to put him to death. 

<sup>33</sup> The Lord will not give him into their hands, or be against him when he is judged. 

<sup>34</sup> Be waiting for the Lord, and keep his way; and you will be lifted up, and have the land for your heritage: when the evil-doers are cut off, you will see it. 

<sup>35</sup> I have seen the evil-doer in great power, covering the earth like a great tree. 

<sup>36</sup> But he came to an end, and there was no sign of him; I made a search for him and he was not there. 

<sup>37</sup> Give attention to the good man, and take note of the upright; because the end of that man is peace. 

<sup>38</sup> But as for the sinners, they will be cut off together; the end of the wrongdoers is destruction. 

<sup>39</sup> But the Lord is the saviour of the upright: he is their strength in the time of trouble. 

<sup>40</sup> And the Lord will be their help, and keep them safe: he will take them out of the hands of the evil-doers, and be their saviour, because they had faith in him.
