# Psalm 34

<sup>1</sup> Of David. When he made a change in his behaviour before Abimelech, who sent him away, and he went. I will be blessing the Lord at all times; his praise will be ever in my mouth. 

<sup>2</sup> My soul will say great things of the Lord: the poor in spirit will have knowledge of it and be glad. 

<sup>3</sup> O give praise to the Lord with me; let us be witnesses together of his great name. 

<sup>4</sup> I was searching for the Lord, and he gave ear to my voice, and made me free from all my fears. 

<sup>5</sup> Let your eyes be turned to him and you will have light, and your faces will not be shamed. 

<sup>6</sup> This poor man's cry came before the Lord, and he gave him salvation from all his troubles. 

<sup>7</sup> The angel of the Lord is ever watching over those who have fear of him, to keep them safe. 

<sup>8</sup> By experience you will see that the Lord is good; happy is the man who has faith in him. 

<sup>9</sup> Keep yourselves in the fear of the Lord, all you his saints; for those who do so will have no need of anything. 

<sup>10</sup> The young lions are in need and have no food; but those who are looking to the Lord will have every good thing. 

<sup>11</sup> Come, children, give attention to me; I will be your teacher in the fear of the Lord. 

<sup>12</sup> What man has a love of life, and a desire that his days may be increased so that he may see good? 

<sup>13</sup> Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from words of deceit. 

<sup>14</sup> Be turned from evil, and do good; make a search for peace, desiring it with all your heart. 

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of the Lord are on the upright, and his ears are open to their cry. 

<sup>16</sup> The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to take away the memory of them from the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> The cry of the upright comes before the Lord, and he takes them out of all their troubles. 

<sup>18</sup> The Lord is near the broken-hearted; he is the saviour of those whose spirits are crushed down. 

<sup>19</sup> Great are the troubles of the upright: but the Lord takes him safely out of them all. 

<sup>20</sup> He keeps all his bones: not one of them is broken. 

<sup>21</sup> Evil will put an end to the sinner, and those who are haters of righteousness will come to destruction. 

<sup>22</sup> The Lord will be the saviour of the souls of his servants, and no one who has faith in him will be put to shame.
