# Psalm 74

<sup>1</sup> Maschil. Of Asaph. Of God, why have you put us away from you for ever? why is the fire of your wrath smoking against the sheep who are your care? 

<sup>2</sup> Keep in mind your band of worshippers, for whom you gave payment in the days which are past, whom you took for yourself as the people of your heritage; even this mountain of Zion, which has been your resting-place. 

<sup>3</sup> Go up and see the unending destruction; all the evil which your haters have done in the holy place; 

<sup>4</sup> Sending out their voices like lions among your worshippers; they have put up their signs to be seen. 

<sup>5</sup> They are cutting down, like a man whose blade is lifted up against the thick trees. 

<sup>6</sup> Your doors are broken down with hammers and iron blades. 

<sup>7</sup> They have put on fire your holy place; they have made the place of your name unclean, pulling it down to the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> They have said in their hearts, Let us put an end to them all together; they have given over to the fire all God's places of worship in the land. 

<sup>9</sup> We do not see our signs: there is no longer any prophet, or anyone among us to say how long. 

<sup>10</sup> O God, how long will those who are against us say cruel things? will the hater go on looking down on your name for ever? 

<sup>11</sup> Why are you keeping back your hand, and covering your right hand in your robe? 

<sup>12</sup> For from the past God is my King, working salvation in the earth. 

<sup>13</sup> The sea was parted in two by your strength; the heads of the great sea-beasts were broken. 

<sup>14</sup> The heads of the great snake were crushed by you; you gave them as food to the fishes of the sea. 

<sup>15</sup> You made valleys for fountains and springs; you made the ever-flowing rivers dry. 

<sup>16</sup> The day is yours and the night is yours: you made the light and the sun. 

<sup>17</sup> By you all the limits of the earth were fixed; you have made summer and winter. 

<sup>18</sup> Keep this in mind, O Lord, that your haters have said cruel things, and that your name has been looked down on by a people of evil behaviour. 

<sup>19</sup> O give not the soul of your dove to the hawk; let not the life of the poor go out of your memory for ever. 

<sup>20</sup> Keep in mind your undertaking; for the dark places of the earth are full of pride and cruel acts. 

<sup>21</sup> O let not the crushed be turned back in shame; let the low man and the poor give praise to your name. 

<sup>22</sup> Up! O God, be the judge of your cause; keep in mind the bitter things which the man of evil behaviour says against you every day. 

<sup>23</sup> Keep in mind the voice of your haters; the outcry of those who come against you goes up every day.
