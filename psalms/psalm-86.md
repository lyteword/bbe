# Psalm 86

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer. Of David. Let your ears be open to my voice, O Lord, and give me an answer; for I am poor and in need. 

<sup>2</sup> Keep my soul, for I am true to you; O my God, give salvation to your servant, whose hope is in you. 

<sup>3</sup> Have mercy on me, O Lord; for my cry goes up to you all the day. 

<sup>4</sup> Make glad the soul of your servant; for it is lifted up to you, O Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> You are good, O Lord, and full of forgiveness; your mercy is great to all who make their cry to you. 

<sup>6</sup> O Lord, give ear to my prayer; and take note of the sound of my requests. 

<sup>7</sup> In the day of my trouble I send up my cry to you; for you will give me an answer. 

<sup>8</sup> There is no god like you, O Lord; there are no works like your works. 

<sup>9</sup> Let all the nations whom you have made come and give worship to you, O Lord, giving glory to your name. 

<sup>10</sup> For you are great, and do great works of wonder; you only are God. 

<sup>11</sup> Make your way clear to me, O Lord; I will go on my way in your faith: let my heart be glad in the fear of your name. 

<sup>12</sup> I will give you praise, O Lord my God, with all my heart; I will give glory to your name for ever. 

<sup>13</sup> For your mercy to me is great; you have taken my soul up from the deep places of the underworld. 

<sup>14</sup> O God, men of pride have come up against me, and the army of violent men would take my life; they have not put you before them. 

<sup>15</sup> But you, O Lord, are a God full of pity and forgiveness, slow to get angry, great in mercy and wisdom. 

<sup>16</sup> O be turned to me and have mercy on me: give your strength to your servant, and your salvation to the son of her who is your servant. 

<sup>17</sup> Give me a sign for good; so that my haters may see it and be shamed; because you, Lord, have been my help and comfort.
