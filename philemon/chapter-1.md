# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith, 

<sup>2</sup> And to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our brother in God's army, and to the church in your house: 

<sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>4</sup> I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you, 

<sup>5</sup> Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints; 

<sup>6</sup> That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good thing in you, for Christ. 

<sup>7</sup> For I had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you, brother. 

<sup>8</sup> And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right, 

<sup>9</sup> Still, because of love, in place of an order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus: 

<sup>10</sup> My request is for my child Onesimus, the child of my chains, 

<sup>11</sup> Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me: 

<sup>12</sup> Whom I have sent back to you, him who is my very heart: 

<sup>13</sup> Though my desire was to keep him with me, to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place: 

<sup>14</sup> But without your approval I would do nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely from your heart. 

<sup>15</sup> For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever; 

<sup>16</sup> No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in the flesh as well as in the Lord. 

<sup>17</sup> If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself. 

<sup>18</sup> If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything, put it to my account. 

<sup>19</sup> I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life. 

<sup>20</sup> So brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ. 

<sup>21</sup> Being certain that you will do my desire, I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say. 

<sup>22</sup> And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you. 

<sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his love; 

<sup>24</sup> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my brother-workers. 

<sup>25</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it.
