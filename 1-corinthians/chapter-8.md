# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Now about things offered to images: we all seem to ourselves to have knowledge. Knowledge gives pride, but love gives true strength. 

<sup>2</sup> If anyone seems to himself to have knowledge, so far he has not the right sort of knowledge about anything; 

<sup>3</sup> But if anyone has love for God, God has knowledge of him. 

<sup>4</sup> So, then, as to the question of taking food offered to images, we are certain that an image is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one. 

<sup>5</sup> For though there are those who have the name of gods, in heaven or on earth, as there are a number of gods and a number of lords, 

<sup>6</sup> There is for us only one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we are for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we have our being through him. 

<sup>7</sup> Still, all men have not that knowledge: but some, being used till now to the image, are conscious that they are taking food which has been offered to the image; and because they are not strong in the faith, their minds are troubled. 

<sup>8</sup> But God's approval of us is not based on the food we take: if we do not take it we are no worse for it; and if we take it we are no better. 

<sup>9</sup> But take care that this power of yours does not give cause for trouble to the feeble. 

<sup>10</sup> For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, taking food as a guest in the house of an image, will it not give him, if he is feeble, the idea that he may take food offered to images? 

<sup>11</sup> And so, through your knowledge, you are the cause of destruction to your brother, for whom Christ underwent death. 

<sup>12</sup> And in this way, doing evil to the brothers, and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble, you are sinning against Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For this reason, if food is a cause of trouble to my brother, I will give up taking meat for ever, so that I may not be a cause of trouble to my brother.
