# Proverbs 17 

**¹** Better a bit of dry bread in peace, than a house full of feasting and violent behaviour.

**²** A servant who does wisely will have rule over a son causing shame, and will have his part in the heritage among brothers.

**³** The heating-pot is for silver and the oven-fire for gold, but the Lord is the tester of hearts.

**⁴** A wrongdoer gives attention to evil lips, and a man of deceit gives ear to a damaging tongue.

**⁵** Whoever makes sport of the poor puts shame on his Maker; and he who is glad because of trouble will not go free from punishment.

**⁶** Children's children are the crown of old men, and the glory of children is their fathers.

**⁷** Fair words are not to be looked for from a foolish man, much less are false lips in a ruler.

**⁸** An offering of money is like a stone of great price in the eyes of him who has it: wherever he goes, he does well.

**⁹** He who keeps a sin covered is looking for love; but he who keeps on talking of a thing makes division between friends.

**¹⁰** A word of protest goes deeper into one who has sense than a hundred blows into a foolish man.

**¹¹** An uncontrolled man is only looking for trouble, so a cruel servant will be sent against him.

**¹²** It is better to come face to face with a bear whose young ones have been taken away than with a foolish man acting foolishly.

**¹³** If anyone gives back evil for good, evil will never go away from his house.

**¹⁴** The start of fighting is like the letting out of water: so give up before it comes to blows.

**¹⁵** He who gives a decision for the evil-doer and he who gives a decision against the upright, are equally disgusting to the Lord.

**¹⁶** How will money in the hand of the foolish get him wisdom, seeing that he has no sense?

**¹⁷** A friend is loving at all times, and becomes a brother in times of trouble.

**¹⁸** A man without sense gives his hand in an agreement, and makes himself responsible before his neighbour.

**¹⁹** The lover of fighting is a lover of sin: he who makes high his doorway is looking for destruction.

**²⁰** Nothing good comes to him whose heart is fixed on evil purposes: and he who has an evil tongue will come to trouble.

**²¹** He who has an unwise son gets sorrow for himself, and the father of a foolish son has no joy.

**²²** A glad heart makes a healthy body, but a crushed spirit makes the bones dry.

**²³** A sinner takes an offering out of his robe, to get a decision for himself in a cause.

**²⁴** Wisdom is before the face of him who has sense; but the eyes of the foolish are on the ends of the earth.

**²⁵** A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitter pain to her who gave him birth.

**²⁶** To give punishment to the upright is not good, or to give blows to the noble for their righteousness.

**²⁷** He who has knowledge says little: and he who has a calm spirit is a man of good sense.

**²⁸** Even the foolish man, when he keeps quiet, is taken to be wise: when his lips are shut he is credited with good sense.
