# Psalm 109

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. Of David. A Psalm. God of my praise, let my prayer be answered; 

<sup>2</sup> For the mouth of the sinner is open against me in deceit: his tongue has said false things against me. 

<sup>3</sup> Words of hate are round about me; they have made war against me without cause. 

<sup>4</sup> For my love they give me back hate; but I have given myself to prayer. 

<sup>5</sup> They have put on me evil for good; hate in exchange for my love. 

<sup>6</sup> Put an evil man over him; and let one be placed at his right hand to say evil of him. 

<sup>7</sup> When he is judged, let the decision go against him; and may his prayer become sin. 

<sup>8</sup> Let his life be short; let another take his position of authority. 

<sup>9</sup> Let his children have no father, and his wife be made a widow. 

<sup>10</sup> Let his children be wanderers, looking to others for their food; let them be sent away from the company of their friends. 

<sup>11</sup> Let his creditor take all his goods; and let others have the profit of his work. 

<sup>12</sup> Let no man have pity on him, or give help to his children when he is dead. 

<sup>13</sup> Let his seed be cut off; in the coming generation let their name go out of memory. 

<sup>14</sup> Let the Lord keep in mind the wrongdoing of his fathers; and may the sin of his mother have no forgiveness. 

<sup>15</sup> Let them be ever before the eyes of the Lord, so that the memory of them may be cut off from the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> Because he had no mercy, but was cruel to the low and the poor, designing the death of the broken-hearted. 

<sup>17</sup> As he took pleasure in cursing, so let it come on him; and as he had no delight in blessing, let it be far from him. 

<sup>18</sup> He put on cursing like a robe, and it has come into his body like water, and into his bones like oil. 

<sup>19</sup> Let it be to him as a robe which he puts on, let it be like a band which is round him at all times. 

<sup>20</sup> Let this be the reward given to my haters from the Lord, and to those who say evil of my soul. 

<sup>21</sup> But, O Lord God, give me your help, because of your name; take me out of danger, because your mercy is good. 

<sup>22</sup> For I am poor and in need, and my heart is wounded in me. 

<sup>23</sup> I am gone like the shade when it is stretched out: I am forced out of my place like a locust. 

<sup>24</sup> My knees are feeble for need of food; there is no fat on my bones. 

<sup>25</sup> As for me, they make sport of me; shaking their heads when they see me. 

<sup>26</sup> Give me help, O Lord my God; in your mercy be my saviour; 

<sup>27</sup> So that they may see that it is the work of your hand; that you, Lord, have done it. 

<sup>28</sup> They may give curses but you give blessing; when they come up against me, put them to shame; but let your servant be glad. 

<sup>29</sup> Let my haters be clothed with shame, covering themselves with shame as with a robe. 

<sup>30</sup> I will give the Lord great praise with my mouth; yes, I will give praise to him among all the people. 

<sup>31</sup> For he is ever at the right hand of the poor, to take him out of the hands of those who go after his soul.
