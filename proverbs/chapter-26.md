# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Like snow in summer and rain when the grain is being cut, so honour is not natural for the foolish. 

<sup>2</sup> As the sparrow in her wandering and the swallow in her flight, so the curse does not come without a cause. 

<sup>3</sup> A whip for the horse, a mouth-bit for the ass, and a rod for the back of the foolish. 

<sup>4</sup> Do not give to the foolish man a foolish answer, or you will be like him. 

<sup>5</sup> Give a foolish man a foolish answer, or he will seem wise to himself. 

<sup>6</sup> He who sends news by the hand of a foolish man is cutting off his feet and drinking in damage. 

<sup>7</sup> The legs of one who has no power of walking are hanging loose; so is a wise saying in the mouth of the foolish. 

<sup>8</sup> Giving honour to a foolish man is like attempting to keep a stone fixed in a cord. 

<sup>9</sup> Like a thorn which goes up into the hand of a man overcome by drink, so is a wise saying in the mouth of a foolish man. 

<sup>10</sup> Like an archer wounding all who go by, is a foolish man overcome by drink. 

<sup>11</sup> Like a dog going back to the food which he has not been able to keep down, is the foolish man doing his foolish acts over again. 

<sup>12</sup> Have you seen a man who seems to himself to be wise? There is more hope for the foolish than for him. 

<sup>13</sup> The hater of work says, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. 

<sup>14</sup> A door is turned on its pillar, and the hater of work on his bed. 

<sup>15</sup> The hater of work puts his hand deep into the basin: lifting it again to his mouth is a weariness to him. 

<sup>16</sup> The hater of work seems to himself wiser than seven men who are able to give an answer with good sense. 

<sup>17</sup> He who gets mixed up in a fight which is not his business, is like one who takes a dog by the ears while it is going by. 

<sup>18</sup> As one who is off his head sends about flaming sticks and arrows of death, 

<sup>19</sup> So is the man who gets the better of his neighbour by deceit, and says, Am I not doing so in sport? 

<sup>20</sup> Without wood, the fire goes out; and where there is no secret talk, argument is ended. 

<sup>21</sup> Like breath on coals and wood on fire, so a man given to argument gets a fight started. 

<sup>22</sup> The words of one who says evil of his neighbour secretly are like sweet food, they go down into the inner parts of the stomach. 

<sup>23</sup> Smooth lips and an evil heart are like a vessel of earth plated with silver waste. 

<sup>24</sup> With his lips the hater makes things seem what they are not, but deceit is stored up inside him; 

<sup>25</sup> When he says fair words, have no belief in him; for in his heart are seven evils: 

<sup>26</sup> Though his hate is covered with deceit, his sin will be seen openly before the meeting of the people. 

<sup>27</sup> He who makes a hole in the earth will himself go falling into it: and on him by whom a stone is rolled the stone will come back again. 

<sup>28</sup> A false tongue has hate for those who have clean hearts, and a smooth mouth is a cause of falling.
