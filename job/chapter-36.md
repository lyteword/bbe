# Chapter 36

**¹** And Elihu went on to say,

**²** Give me a little more time, and I will make it clear to you; for I have still something to say for God.

**³** I will get my knowledge from far, and I will give righteousness to my Maker.

**⁴** For truly my words are not false; one who has all knowledge is talking with you.

**⁵** Truly, God gives up the hard-hearted, and will not give life to the sinner.

**⁶** His eyes are ever on the upright, and he gives to the crushed their right;

**⁷** Lifting them up to the seat of kings, and making them safe for ever.

**⁸** And if they have been prisoned in chains, and taken in cords of trouble,

**⁹** Then he makes clear to them what they have done, even their evil works in which they have taken pride.

**¹⁰** Their ear is open to his teaching, and he gives them orders so that their hearts may be turned from evil.

**¹¹** If they give ear to his voice, and do his word, then he gives them long life, and years full of pleasure.

**¹²** But if not, they come to their end, and give up their breath without knowledge.

**¹³** Those who have no fear of God keep wrath stored up in their hearts; they give no cry for help when they are made prisoners.

**¹⁴** They come to their end while they are still young, their life is short like that of those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of their gods.

**¹⁵** He makes the wrong done to the poor the way of their salvation, opening their ears by their trouble.

**¹⁶** ...

**¹⁷** ...

**¹⁸** ...

**¹⁹** ...

**²⁰** ...

**²¹** Take care not to be turned to sin, for you have taken evil for your part in place of sorrow.

**²²** Truly God is lifted up in strength; who is a ruler like him?

**²³** Who ever gave orders to him, or said to him, You have done wrong?

**²⁴** See that you give praise to his work, about which men make songs.

**²⁵** All people are looking on it; man sees it from far.

**²⁶** Truly, God is great, greater than all our knowledge; the number of his years may not be searched out.

**²⁷** For he takes up the drops from the sea; he sends them through his mist as rain,

**²⁸** Flowing down from the sky, and dropping on the peoples.

**²⁹** And who has knowledge of how the clouds are stretched out, or of the thunders of his tent?

**³⁰** See, he is stretching out his mist, covering the tops of the mountains with it.

**³¹** For by these he gives food to the peoples, and bread in full measure.

**³²** He takes the light in his hands, sending it against the mark.

**³³** The thunder makes clear his passion, and the storm gives news of his wrath.
