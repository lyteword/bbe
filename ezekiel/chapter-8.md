# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Now in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in my house and the responsible men of Judah were seated before me, the hand of the Lord came on me there.

<sup>2</sup> And looking, I saw a form like fire; from the middle of his body and down there was fire: and up from the middle of his body a sort of shining, like electrum.

<sup>3</sup> And he put out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head; and the wind, lifting me up between the earth and the heaven, took me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the way into the inner door facing to the north; where was the seat of the image of envy.

<sup>4</sup> And I saw the glory of the Lord there, as in the vision which I saw in the valley.

<sup>5</sup> Then he said to me, Son of man, now let your eyes be lifted up in the direction of the north; and on looking in the direction of the north, to the north of the doorway of the altar, I saw this image of envy by the way in.

<sup>6</sup> And he said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing? even the very disgusting things which the children of Israel are doing here, causing me to go far away from my holy place? but you will see other most disgusting things.

<sup>7</sup> And he took me to the door of the open place; and looking, I saw a hole in the wall.

<sup>8</sup> And he said to me, Son of man, make a hole in the wall: and after making a hole in the wall I saw a door.

<sup>9</sup> And he said to me, Go in and see the evil and disgusting things which they are doing here.

<sup>10</sup> So I went in and saw; and there every sort of living thing which goes flat on the earth, and unclean beasts, and all the images of the children of Israel, were pictured round about on the wall.

<sup>11</sup> And before them seventy of the responsible men of the children of Israel had taken their places, every man with a vessel for burning perfumes in his hand, and in the middle of them was Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan; and a cloud of smoke went up from the burning perfume.

<sup>12</sup> And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the responsible men of the children of Israel do in the dark, every man in his room of pictured images? for they say, The Lord does not see us; the Lord has gone away from the land.

<sup>13</sup> Then he said to me, You will see even more disgusting things which they do.

<sup>14</sup> Then he took me to the door of the way into the Lord's house looking to the north; and there women were seated weeping for Tammuz.

<sup>15</sup> Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? you will see even more disgusting things than these.

<sup>16</sup> And he took me into the inner square of the Lord's house, and at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the covered way and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs turned to the Temple of the Lord and their faces turned to the east; and they were worshipping the sun, turning to the east.

<sup>17</sup> Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? is it a small thing to the children of Judah that they do the disgusting things which they are doing here? for they have made the land full of violent behaviour, making me angry again and again: and see, they put the branch to my nose.

<sup>18</sup> For this reason I will let loose my wrath: my eye will not have mercy, and I will have no pity.
