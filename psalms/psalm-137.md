# Psalm 137

<sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon we were seated, weeping at the memory of Zion,

<sup>2</sup> Hanging our instruments of music on the trees by the waterside.

<sup>3</sup> For there those who had taken us prisoners made request for a song; and those who had taken away all we had gave us orders to be glad, saying, Give us one of the songs of Zion.

<sup>4</sup> How may we give the Lord's song in a strange land?

<sup>5</sup> If I keep not your memory, O Jerusalem, let not my right hand keep the memory of its art.

<sup>6</sup> If I let you go out of my thoughts, and if I do not put Jerusalem before my greatest joy, let my tongue be fixed to the roof of my mouth.

<sup>7</sup> O Lord, keep in mind against the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem; how they said, Let it be uncovered, uncovered even to its base.

<sup>8</sup> O daughter of Babylon, whose fate is destruction; happy is the man who does to you what you have done to us.

<sup>9</sup> Happy is the man who takes your little ones, crushing them against the rocks.
