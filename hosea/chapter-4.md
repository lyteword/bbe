# Hosea 4 

**¹** Give ear to the word of the Lord, O children of Israel; for the Lord has a cause against the people of this land, because there is no good faith in it, and no mercy and no knowledge of God in the land.

**²** There is cursing and broken faith, violent death and attacks on property, men are untrue in married life, houses are broken into, and there is blood touching blood.

**³** Because of this the land will be dry, and everyone living in it will be wasted away, with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven; even the fishes of the sea will be taken away.

**⁴** Let no man go to law or make protests, for your people are like those who go to law with a priest.

**⁵** You will not be able to keep on your feet by day, and by night the prophet will be falling down with you, and I will give your mother to destruction.

**⁶** Destruction has overtaken my people because they have no knowledge; because you have given up knowledge, I will give you up, so that you will be no priest to me, because you have not kept in mind the law of your God, I will not keep your children in my memory.

**⁷** Even while they were increasing in number they were sinning against me; I will let their glory be changed into shame.

**⁸** The sin of my people is like food to them; and their desire is for their wrongdoing.

**⁹** And the priest will be like the people; I will give them punishment for their evil ways, and the reward of their acts.

**¹⁰** They will have food, but they will not be full; they will be false to me, but they will not be increased, because they no longer give thought to the Lord.

**¹¹** Loose ways and new wine take away wisdom.

**¹²** My people get knowledge from their tree, and their rod gives them news; for a false spirit is the cause of their wandering, and they have been false to their God.

**¹³** They make offerings on the tops of mountains, burning perfumes in high places, under trees of every sort, because their shade is good: and so your daughters are given up to loose ways and your brides are false to their husbands.

**¹⁴** I will not give punishment to your daughters or your brides for their evil behaviour; for they make themselves separate with loose women, and make offerings with those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods: the people who have no wisdom will be sent away.

**¹⁵** Do not you, O Israel, come into error; do not you, O Judah, come to Gilgal, or go up to Beth-aven, or take an oath, By the living Lord.

**¹⁶** For Israel is uncontrolled, like a cow which may not be controlled; now will the Lord give them food like a lamb in a wide place.

**¹⁷** Ephraim is joined to false gods; let him be.

**¹⁸** Their drink has become bitter; they are completely false; her rulers take pleasure in shame.

**¹⁹** They are folded in the skirts of the wind; they will be shamed because of their offerings.
