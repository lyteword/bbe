# Psalm 16

Michtam. Of David.

**¹** Keep me safe, O God: for in you I have put my faith.

**²** O my soul, you have said to the Lord, You are my Lord: I have no good but you.

**³** As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the noble in whom is all my delight.

**⁴** Their sorrows will be increased who go after another god: I will not take drink offerings from their hands, or take their names on my lips.

**⁵** The Lord is my heritage and the wine of my cup; you are the supporter of my right.

**⁶** Fair are the places marked out for me; I have a noble heritage.

**⁷** I will give praise to the Lord who has been my guide; knowledge comes to me from my thoughts in the night.

**⁸** I have put the Lord before me at all times; because he is at my right hand, I will not be moved.

**⁹** Because of this my heart is glad, and my glory is full of joy: while my flesh takes its rest in hope.

**¹⁰** For you will not let my soul be prisoned in the underworld; you will not let your loved one see the place of death.

**¹¹** You will make clear to me the way of life; where you are joy is complete; in your right hand there are pleasures for ever and ever.
