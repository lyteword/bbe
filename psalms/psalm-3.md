# Psalm 3

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Of David. When he went in flight from Absalom his son. Lord, how greatly are they increased who make attacks on me! in great numbers they come against me. 

<sup>2</sup> Unnumbered are those who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. (Selah.) 

<sup>3</sup> But your strength, O Lord, is round me, you are my glory and the lifter up of my head. 

<sup>4</sup> I send up a cry to the Lord with my voice, and he gives me an answer from his holy hill. (Selah.) 

<sup>5</sup> I took my rest in sleep, and then again I was awake; for the Lord was my support. 

<sup>6</sup> I will have no fear, though ten thousand have come round me, putting themselves against me. 

<sup>7</sup> Come to me, Lord; keep me safe, O my God; for you have given all my haters blows on their face-bones; the teeth of the evil-doers have been broken by you. 

<sup>8</sup> Salvation comes from the Lord; your blessing is on your people. (Selah.)
