# Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> And Job again took up the word and said, 

<sup>2</sup> If only I might again be as I was in the months which are past, in the days when God was watching over me! 

<sup>3</sup> When his light was shining over my head, and when I went through the dark by his light. 

<sup>4</sup> As I was in my flowering years, when my tent was covered by the hand of God; 

<sup>5</sup> While the Ruler of all was still with me, and my children were round me; 

<sup>6</sup> When my steps were washed with milk, and rivers of oil were flowing out of the rock for me. 

<sup>7</sup> When I went out of my door to go up to the town, and took my seat in the public place, 

<sup>8</sup> The young men saw me, and went away, and the old men got up from their seats; 

<sup>9</sup> The rulers kept quiet, and put their hands on their mouths; 

<sup>10</sup> The chiefs kept back their words, and their tongues were joined to the roofs of their mouths. 

<sup>11</sup> For when it came to their ears, men said that I was truly happy; and when their eyes saw, they gave witness to me; 

<sup>12</sup> For I was a saviour to the poor when he was crying for help, to the child with no father, and to him who had no supporter. 

<sup>13</sup> The blessing of him who was near to destruction came on me, and I put a song of joy into the widow's heart. 

<sup>14</sup> I put on righteousness as my clothing, and was full of it; right decisions were to me a robe and a head-dress. 

<sup>15</sup> I was eyes to the blind, and feet to him who had no power of walking. 

<sup>16</sup> I was a father to the poor, searching out the cause of him who was strange to me. 

<sup>17</sup> By me the great teeth of the evil-doer were broken, and I made him give up what he had violently taken away. 

<sup>18</sup> Then I said, I will come to my end with my children round me, my days will be as the sand in number; 

<sup>19</sup> My root will be open to the waters, and the night mist will be on my branches, 

<sup>20</sup> My glory will be ever new, and my bow will be readily bent in my hand. 

<sup>21</sup> Men gave ear to me, waiting and keeping quiet for my suggestions. 

<sup>22</sup> After I had said what was in my mind, they were quiet and let my words go deep into their hearts; 

<sup>23</sup> They were waiting for me as for the rain, opening their mouths wide as for the spring rains. 

<sup>24</sup> I was laughing at them when they had no hope, and the light of my face was never clouded by their fear. 

<sup>25</sup> I took my place as a chief, guiding them on their way, and I was as a king among his army. ...
