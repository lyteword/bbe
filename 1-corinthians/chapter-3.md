# Chapter 3

**¹** And the teaching I gave you, my brothers, was such as I was able to give, not to those who have the Spirit, but to those who are still in the flesh, even to children in Christ.

**²** I gave you milk and not meat, because you were, then, unable to take it, and even now you are not able;

**³** Because you are still in the flesh: for when there is envy and division among you, are you not still walking after the way of the flesh, even as natural men?

**⁴** For when one says, I am of Paul; and another says, I am of Apollos; are you not talking like natural men?

**⁵** What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? They are but servants who gave you the good news as God gave it to them.

**⁶** I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God gave the increase.

**⁷** So then the planter is nothing, and the waterer is nothing; but God who gives the increase.

**⁸** Now the planter and the waterer are working for the same end: but they will have their separate rewards in the measure of their work.

**⁹** For we are workers with God: you are God's planting, God's building.

**¹⁰** In the measure of the grace given to me, I, as a wise master-builder, have put the base in position, and another goes on building on it. But let every man take care what he puts on it.

**¹¹** For there is no other base for the building but that which has been put down, which is Jesus Christ.

**¹²** But on the base a man may put gold, silver, stones of great price, wood, dry grass, cut stems;

**¹³** Every man's work will be made clear in that day, because it will be tested by fire; and the fire itself will make clear the quality of every man's work.

**¹⁴** If any man's work comes through the test, he will have a reward.

**¹⁵** If the fire puts an end to any man's work, it will be his loss: but he will get salvation himself, though as by fire.

**¹⁶** Do you not see that you are God's holy house, and that the Spirit of God has his place in you?

**¹⁷** If anyone makes the house of God unclean, God will put an end to him; for the house of God is holy, and you are his house.

**¹⁸** Let no man have a false idea. If any man seems to himself to be wise among you, let him become foolish, so that he may be wise.

**¹⁹** For the wisdom of this world is foolish before God. As it is said in the holy Writings, He who takes the wise in their secret designs:

**²⁰** And again, The Lord has knowledge of the reasonings of the wise, that they are nothing.

**²¹** So let no one take pride in men. For all things are yours;

**²²** Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;

**²³** And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
