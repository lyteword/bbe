# Chapter 25

<sup>2</sup> Rule and power are his; he makes peace in his high places. 

<sup>3</sup> Is it possible for his armies to be numbered? and on whom is not his light shining? 

<sup>4</sup> How then is it possible for man to be upright before God? or how may he be clean who is a son of woman? 

<sup>5</sup> See, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not clean in his eyes: 

<sup>6</sup> How much less man who is an insect, and the son of man who is a worm!
