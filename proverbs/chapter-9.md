# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Wisdom has made her house, putting up her seven pillars. 

<sup>2</sup> She has put her fat beasts to death; her wine is mixed, her table is ready. 

<sup>3</sup> She has sent out her women-servants; her voice goes out to the highest places of the town, saying, 

<sup>4</sup> Whoever is simple, let him come in here; and to him who has no sense, she says: 

<sup>5</sup> Come, take of my bread, and of my wine which is mixed. 

<sup>6</sup> Give up the simple ones and have life, and go in the way of knowledge. 

<sup>7</sup> He who gives teaching to a man of pride gets shame for himself; he who says sharp words to a sinner gets a bad name. 

<sup>8</sup> Do not say sharp words to a man of pride, or he will have hate for you; make them clear to a wise man, and you will be dear to him. 

<sup>9</sup> Give teaching to a wise man, and he will become wiser; give training to an upright man, and his learning will be increased. 

<sup>10</sup> The fear of the Lord is the start of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One gives a wise mind 

<sup>11</sup> For by me your days will be increased, and the years of your life will be long. 

<sup>12</sup> If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if your heart is full of pride, you only will have the pain of it. 

<sup>13</sup> The foolish woman is full of noise; she has no sense at all. 

<sup>14</sup> Seated at the door of her house, in the high places of the town, 

<sup>15</sup> Crying out to those who go by, going straight on their way, she says: 

<sup>16</sup> Whoever is simple, let him come in here: and to him who is without sense, she says: 

<sup>17</sup> Drink taken without right is sweet, and food in secret is pleasing. 

<sup>18</sup> But he does not see that the dead are there, that her guests are in the deep places of the underworld.
