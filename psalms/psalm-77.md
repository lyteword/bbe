# Psalm 77

To the chief music-maker. After Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A Psalm.

<sup>1</sup> I was crying to God with my voice; even to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.

<sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble, my heart was turned to the Lord: my hand was stretched out in the night without resting; my soul would not be comforted.

<sup>3</sup> I will keep God in memory, with sounds of grief; my thoughts are troubled, and my spirit is overcome. (Selah.)

<sup>4</sup> You keep my eyes from sleep; I am so troubled that no words come.

<sup>5</sup> My thoughts go back to the days of the past, to the years which are gone.

<sup>6</sup> The memory of my song comes back to me in the night; my thoughts are moving in my heart; my spirit is searching with care.

<sup>7</sup> Will the Lord put me away for ever? will he be kind no longer?

<sup>8</sup> Is his mercy quite gone for ever? has his word come to nothing?

<sup>9</sup> Has God put away the memory of his pity? are his mercies shut up by his wrath? (Selah.)

<sup>10</sup> And I said, It is a weight on my spirit; but I will keep in mind the years of the right hand of the Most High.

<sup>11</sup> I will keep in mind the works of Jah: I will keep the memory of your wonders in the past.

<sup>12</sup> I will give thought to all your work, while my mind goes over your acts of power.

<sup>13</sup> Your way, O God, is holy: what god is so great as our God?

<sup>14</sup> You are the God who does works of power: you have made your strength clear to the nations.

<sup>15</sup> With your arm you have made your people free, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah.)

<sup>16</sup> The waters saw you, O God; the waters saw you, they were in fear: even the deep was troubled.

<sup>17</sup> The clouds sent out water; the skies gave out a sound; truly, your arrows went far and wide.

<sup>18</sup> The voice of your thunder went rolling on; the world was flaming with the light of the storm; the earth was shaking.

<sup>19</sup> Your way was in the sea, and your road in the great waters; there was no knowledge of your footsteps.

<sup>20</sup> You were guiding your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
