# Psalm 125 

A Song of the going up.

**¹** Those whose hope is in the Lord are like the mountain of Zion, which may not be moved, but keeps its place for ever.

**²** As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people, from this time and for ever.

**³** For the rod of sinners will not be resting on the heritage of the upright; so that the upright may not put out their hands to evil.

**⁴** Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in heart.

**⁵** But as for such as are turned out of the straight way, the Lord will take them away with the workers of evil. Let peace be on Israel.
