# Psalm 90

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, you have been our resting-place in all generations. 

<sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were made, before you had given birth to the earth and the world, before time was, and for ever, you are God. 

<sup>3</sup> You send man back to his dust; and say, Go back, you children of men. 

<sup>4</sup> For to you a thousand years are no more than yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night. 

<sup>5</sup> ... 

<sup>6</sup> In the morning it is green; in the evening it is cut down, and becomes dry. 

<sup>7</sup> We are burned up by the heat of your passion, and troubled by your wrath. 

<sup>8</sup> You have put our evil doings before you, our secret sins in the light of your face. 

<sup>9</sup> For all our days have gone by in your wrath; our years come to an end like a breath. 

<sup>10</sup> The measure of our life is seventy years; and if through strength it may be eighty years, its pride is only trouble and sorrow, for it comes to an end and we are quickly gone. 

<sup>11</sup> Who has knowledge of the power of your wrath, or who takes note of the weight of your passion? 

<sup>12</sup> So give us knowledge of the number of our days, that we may get a heart of wisdom. 

<sup>13</sup> Come back, O Lord; how long? let your purpose for your servants be changed. 

<sup>14</sup> In the morning give us your mercy in full measure; so that we may have joy and delight all our days. 

<sup>15</sup> Make us glad in reward for the days of our sorrow, and for the years in which we have seen evil. 

<sup>16</sup> Make your work clear to your servants, and your glory to their children. 

<sup>17</sup> Let the pleasure of the Lord our God be on us: O Lord, give strength to the work of our hands.
