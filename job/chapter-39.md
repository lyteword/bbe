# Chapter 39

<sup>1</sup> Have you knowledge of the rock-goats? or do you see the roes giving birth to their young?

<sup>2</sup> Is the number of their months fixed by you? or is the time when they give birth ordered by you?

<sup>3</sup> They are bent down, they give birth to their young, they let loose the fruit of their body.

<sup>4</sup> Their young ones are strong, living in the open country; they go out and do not come back again.

<sup>5</sup> Who has let the ass of the fields go free? or made loose the bands of the loud-voiced beast?

<sup>6</sup> To whom I have given the waste land for a heritage, and the salt land as a living-place.

<sup>7</sup> He makes sport of the noise of the town; the voice of the driver does not come to his ears;

<sup>8</sup> He goes looking for his grass-lands in the mountains, searching out every green thing.

<sup>9</sup> Will the ox of the mountains be your servant? or is his night's resting-place by your food-store?

<sup>10</sup> Will he be pulling your plough with cords, turning up the valleys after you?

<sup>11</sup> Will you put your faith in him, because his strength is great? will you give the fruit of your work into his care?

<sup>12</sup> Will you be looking for him to come back, and get in your seed to the crushing-floor?

<sup>13</sup> Is the wing of the ostrich feeble, or is it because she has no feathers,

<sup>14</sup> That she puts her eggs on the earth, warming them in the dust,

<sup>15</sup> Without a thought that they may be crushed by the foot, and broken by the beasts of the field?

<sup>16</sup> She is cruel to her young ones, as if they were not hers; her work is to no purpose; she has no fear.

<sup>17</sup> For God has taken wisdom from her mind, and given her no measure of knowledge.

<sup>18</sup> When she is shaking her wings on high, she makes sport of the horse and of him who is seated on him.

<sup>19</sup> Do you give strength to the horse? is it by your hand that his neck is clothed with power?

<sup>20</sup> Is it through you that he is shaking like a locust, in the pride of his loud-sounding breath?

<sup>21</sup> He is stamping with joy in the valley; he makes sport of fear.

<sup>22</sup> In his strength he goes out against the arms of war, turning not away from the sword.

<sup>23</sup> The bow is sounding against him; he sees the shining point of spear and arrow.

<sup>24</sup> Shaking with passion, he is biting the earth; he is not able to keep quiet at the sound of the horn;

<sup>25</sup> When it comes to his ears he says, Aha! He is smelling the fight from far off, and hearing the thunder of the captains, and the war-cries.

<sup>26</sup> Is it through your knowledge that the hawk takes his flight, stretching out his wings to the south?

<sup>27</sup> Or is it by your orders that the eagle goes up, and makes his resting-place on high?

<sup>28</sup> On the rock is his house, and on the mountain-top his strong place.

<sup>29</sup> From there he is watching for food; his eye sees it far off.

<sup>30</sup> His young have blood for their drink, and where the dead bodies are, there is he to be seen.
