# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> See, you are fair, my love, you are fair; you have the eyes of a dove; your hair is as a flock of goats, which take their rest on the side of Gilead. 

<sup>2</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of sheep whose wool is newly cut, which come up from the washing; every one has two lambs, and there is not one without young. 

<sup>3</sup> Your red lips are like a bright thread, and your mouth is fair of form; the sides of your head are like pomegranate fruit under your veil. 

<sup>4</sup> Your neck is like the tower of David made for a store-house of arms, in which a thousand breastplates are hanging, breastplates for fighting-men. 

<sup>5</sup> Your two breasts are like two young roes of the same birth, which take their food among the lilies. 

<sup>6</sup> Till the evening comes, and the sky slowly becomes dark, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. 

<sup>7</sup> You are all fair, my love; there is no mark on you. 

<sup>8</sup> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon; see from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the places of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards. 

<sup>9</sup> You have taken away my heart, my sister, my bride; you have taken away my heart, with one look you have taken it, with one chain of your neck! 

<sup>10</sup> How fair is your love, my sister! How much better is your love than wine, and the smell of your oils than any perfume! 

<sup>11</sup> Your lips are dropping honey; honey and milk are under your tongue; and the smell of your clothing is like the smell of Lebanon. 

<sup>12</sup> A garden walled-in is my sister, my bride; a garden shut up, a spring of water stopped. 

<sup>13</sup> The produce of the garden is pomegranates; with all the best fruits, henna and spikenard, 

<sup>14</sup> Spikenard and safron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices. 

<sup>15</sup> You are a fountain of gardens, a spring of living waters, and flowing waters from Lebanon. 

<sup>16</sup> Be awake, O north wind; and come, O south, blowing on my garden, so that its spices may come out. Let my loved one come into his garden, and take of his good fruits.
