# Job 18 

**¹** Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,

**²** How long will it be before you have done talking? Get wisdom, and then we will say what is in our minds.

**³** Why do we seem as beasts in your eyes, and as completely without knowledge?

**⁴** But come back, now, come: you who are wounding yourself in your passion, will the earth be given up because of you, or a rock be moved out of its place?

**⁵** For the light of the sinner is put out, and the flame of his fire is not shining.

**⁶** The light is dark in his tent, and the light shining over him is put out.

**⁷** The steps of his strength become short, and by his design destruction overtakes him.

**⁸** His feet take him into the net, and he goes walking into the cords.

**⁹** His foot is taken in the net; he comes into its grip.

**¹⁰** The twisted cord is put secretly in the earth to take him, and the cord is placed in his way.

**¹¹** He is overcome by fears on every side, they go after him at every step.

**¹²** His strength is made feeble for need of food, and destruction is waiting for his falling footstep.

**¹³** His skin is wasted by disease, and his body is food for the worst of diseases.

**¹⁴** He is pulled out of his tent where he was safe, and he is taken away to the king of fears.

**¹⁵** In his tent will be seen that which is not his, burning stone is dropped on his house.

**¹⁶** Under the earth his roots are dry, and over it his branch is cut off.

**¹⁷** His memory is gone from the earth, and in the open country there is no knowledge of his name.

**¹⁸** He is sent away from the light into the dark; he is forced out of the world.

**¹⁹** He has no offspring or family among his people, and in his living-place there is no one of his name.

**²⁰** At his fate those of the west are shocked, and those of the east are overcome with fear.

**²¹** Truly, these are the houses of the sinner, and this is the place of him who has no knowledge of God.
