# Psalm 122 

A Song of the going up. Of David.

**¹** I was glad because they said to me, We will go into the house of the Lord.

**²** At last our feet were inside your doors, O Jerusalem.

**³** O Jerusalem, you are like a town which is well joined together;

**⁴** To which the tribes went up, even the tribes of the Lord, for a witness to Israel, to give praise to the name of the Lord.

**⁵** For there seats for the judges were placed, even the rulers' seats of the line of David.

**⁶** O make prayers for the peace of Jerusalem; may they whose love is given to you do well.

**⁷** May peace be inside your walls, and wealth in your noble houses.

**⁸** Because of my brothers and friends, I will now say, Let peace be with you.

**⁹** Because of the house of the Lord our God, I will be working for your good.
