# Chapter 40

<sup>1</sup> ... 

<sup>2</sup> Will he who is protesting give teaching to the Ruler of all? Let him who has arguments to put forward against God give an answer. 

<sup>3</sup> And Job said in answer to the Lord, 

<sup>4</sup> Truly, I am of no value; what answer may I give to you? I will put my hand on my mouth. 

<sup>5</sup> I have said once, and even twice, what was in my mind, but I will not do so again. 

<sup>6</sup> Then the Lord made answer to Job out of the storm-wind, and said, 

<sup>7</sup> Get your strength together like a man of war: I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers. 

<sup>8</sup> Will you even make my right of no value? will you say that I am wrong in order to make clear that you are right? 

<sup>9</sup> Have you an arm like God? have you a voice of thunder like his? 

<sup>10</sup> Put on the ornaments of your pride; be clothed with glory and power: 

<sup>11</sup> Let your wrath be overflowing; let your eyes see all the sons of pride, and make them low. 

<sup>12</sup> Send destruction on all who are lifted up, pulling down the sinners from their places. 

<sup>13</sup> Let them be covered together in the dust; let their faces be dark in the secret place of the underworld. 

<sup>14</sup> Then I will give praise to you, saying that your right hand is able to give you salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> See now the Great Beast, whom I made, even as I made you; he takes grass for food, like the ox. 

<sup>16</sup> His strength is in his body, and his force in the muscles of his stomach. 

<sup>17</sup> His tail is curving like a cedar; the muscles of his legs are joined together. 

<sup>18</sup> His bones are pipes of brass, his legs are like rods of iron. 

<sup>19</sup> He is the chief of the ways of God, made by him for his pleasure. 

<sup>20</sup> He takes the produce of the mountains, where all the beasts of the field are at play. 

<sup>21</sup> He takes his rest under the trees of the river, and in the pool, under the shade of the water-plants. 

<sup>22</sup> He is covered by the branches of the trees; the grasses of the stream are round him. 

<sup>23</sup> Truly, if the river is overflowing, it gives him no cause for fear; he has no sense of danger, even if Jordan is rushing against his mouth. 

<sup>24</sup> Will anyone take him when he is on the watch, or put metal teeth through his nose?
