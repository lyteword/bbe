# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> Has not man his ordered time of trouble on the earth? and are not his days like the days of a servant working for payment? 

<sup>2</sup> As a servant desiring the shades of evening, and a workman looking for his payment: 

<sup>3</sup> So I have for my heritage months of pain to no purpose, and nights of weariness are given to me. 

<sup>4</sup> When I go to my bed, I say, When will it be time to get up? but the night is long, and I am turning from side to side till morning light. 

<sup>5</sup> My flesh is covered with worms and dust; my skin gets hard and then is cracked again. 

<sup>6</sup> My days go quicker than the cloth-worker's thread, and come to an end without hope. 

<sup>7</sup> O, keep in mind that my life is wind: my eye will never again see good. 

<sup>8</sup> The eye of him who sees me will see me no longer: your eyes will be looking for me, but I will be gone. 

<sup>9</sup> A cloud comes to an end and is gone; so he who goes down into the underworld comes not up again. 

<sup>10</sup> He will not come back to his house, and his place will have no more knowledge of him. 

<sup>11</sup> So I will not keep my mouth shut; I will let the words come from it in the pain of my spirit, my soul will make a bitter outcry. 

<sup>12</sup> Am I a sea, or a sea-beast, that you put a watch over me? 

<sup>13</sup> When I say, In my bed I will have comfort, there I will get rest from my disease; 

<sup>14</sup> Then you send dreams to me, and visions of fear; 

<sup>15</sup> So that a hard death seems better to my soul than my pains. 

<sup>16</sup> I have no desire for life, I would not be living for ever! Keep away from me, for my days are as a breath. 

<sup>17</sup> What is man, that you have made him great, and that your attention is fixed on him, 

<sup>18</sup> And that your hand is on him every morning, and that you are testing him every minute? 

<sup>19</sup> How long will it be before your eyes are turned away from me, so that I may have a minute's breathing-space? 

<sup>20</sup> If I have done wrong, what have I done to you, O keeper of men? why have you made me a mark for your blows, so that I am a weariness to myself? 

<sup>21</sup> And why do you not take away my sin, and let my wrongdoing be ended? for now I go down to the dust, and you will be searching for me with care, but I will be gone.
