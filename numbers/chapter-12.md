# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Now Miriam and Aaron said evil against Moses, because of the Cushite woman to whom he was married, for he had taken a Cushite woman as his wife. 

<sup>2</sup> And they said, Have the words of the Lord been given to Moses only? have they not come to us? And the Lord took note of it. 

<sup>3</sup> Now the man Moses was more gentle than any other man on earth. 

<sup>4</sup> And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the Tent of meeting. And the three of them went out. 

<sup>5</sup> And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, taking his place at the door of the Tent, and made Aaron and Miriam come before him. 

<sup>6</sup> And he said, Now give ear to my words: if there is a prophet among you I will give him knowledge of myself in a vision and will let my words come to him in a dream. 

<sup>7</sup> My servant Moses is not so; he is true to me in all my house: 

<sup>8</sup> With him I will have talk mouth to mouth, openly and not in dark sayings; and with his eyes he will see the form of the Lord: why then had you no fear of saying evil against my servant Moses? 

<sup>9</sup> And burning with wrath against them, the Lord went away. 

<sup>10</sup> And the cloud was moved from over the Tent; and straight away Miriam became a leper, as white as snow: and Aaron, looking at Miriam, saw that she was a leper. 

<sup>11</sup> Then Aaron said to Moses, O my lord, let not our sin be on our heads, for we have done foolishly and are sinners. 

<sup>12</sup> Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half wasted when he comes out from the body of his mother. 

<sup>13</sup> And Moses, crying to the Lord, said, Let my prayer come before you, O God, and make her well. 

<sup>14</sup> And the Lord said to Moses, If her father had put a mark of shame on her, would she not be shamed for seven days? Let her be shut up outside the tent-circle for seven days, and after that she may come in again. 

<sup>15</sup> So Miriam was shut up outside the tent-circle for seven days: and the people did not go forward on their journey till Miriam had come in again. 

<sup>16</sup> After that, the people went on from Hazeroth and put up their tents in the waste land of Paran.
