# Psalm 100

A Psalm of Praise.

<sup>1</sup> Make a glad sound to the Lord, all the earth.

<sup>2</sup> Give worship to the Lord with joy; come before him with a song.

<sup>3</sup> Be certain that the Lord is God; it is he who has made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep to whom he gives food.

<sup>4</sup> Come into his doors with joy, and into his house with praise; give him honour, blessing his name.

<sup>5</sup> For the Lord is good, and his mercy is never-ending; his faith is unchanging through all generations.
