# Psalm 92

A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath.

**¹** It is a good thing to give praise to the Lord, and to make melody to your name, O Most High;

**²** To make clear your mercy in the morning, and your unchanging faith every night;

**³** On a ten-corded instrument, and on an instrument of music with a quiet sound.

**⁴** For you, O Lord, have made me glad through your work; I will have joy in the works of your hands.

**⁵** O Lord, how great are your works! and your thoughts are very deep.

**⁶** A man without sense has no knowledge of this; and a foolish man may not take it in.

**⁷** When the sinners come up like the grass, and all the workers of evil do well for themselves, it is so that their end may be eternal destruction.

**⁸** But you, O Lord, are on high for ever.

**⁹** For see! your haters, O Lord, will be put to death; all the workers of evil will be put to flight;

**¹⁰** But my horn is lifted up like the horn of the ox: the best oil is flowing on my head.

**¹¹** My eyes have seen trouble come on my haters; my ears have news of the fate of the evil-doers who have come up against me.

**¹²** The good man will be like a tall tree in his strength; his growth will be as the wide-stretching trees of Lebanon.

**¹³** Those who are planted in the house of the Lord will come up tall and strong in his gardens.

**¹⁴** They will give fruit even when they are old; they will be fertile and full of growth;

**¹⁵** For a sign that the Lord is upright; he is my Rock, there is no deceit in him.
