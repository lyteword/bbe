# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Now the Apostles and the brothers who were in Judaea had news that the word of God had been given to the Gentiles.

<sup>2</sup> And when Peter came to Jerusalem, those who kept the rule of circumcision had an argument with him,

<sup>3</sup> Saying, You went to men without circumcision, and took food with them.

<sup>4</sup> But Peter gave them an account of it all in order, saying to them,

<sup>5</sup> I was in the town of Joppa, at prayer: and falling into a deep sleep, I saw in a vision a vessel like a great cloth let down from heaven, and it came down to me:

<sup>6</sup> And looking on it with attention I saw in it all sorts of beasts and birds.

<sup>7</sup> And a voice came to my ears saying, Come, Peter; take them for food.

<sup>8</sup> But I said, No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever come into my mouth.

<sup>9</sup> But the voice, coming a second time from heaven, said, What God has made clean, do not you make common.

<sup>10</sup> And this was done three times, and they were all taken up again into heaven.

<sup>11</sup> And at that minute, three men, sent from Caesarea, came to the house where we were.

<sup>12</sup> And the Spirit gave me orders to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brothers came with me; and we went into that man's house:

<sup>13</sup> And he gave us an account of how he had seen the angel in his house, saying, Send to Joppa, and get Simon, named Peter, to come to you;

<sup>14</sup> Who will say words to you through which you and all your family may get salvation.

<sup>15</sup> And, while I was talking to them, the Holy Spirit came on them, as on us at first.

<sup>16</sup> And the words of the Lord came into my mind, how he said, The baptism of John was with water, but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit.

<sup>17</sup> If then God gave them, when they had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the same as he gave to us, who was I to go against God?

<sup>18</sup> And hearing these things they said nothing more, but gave glory to God, saying, Then to the Gentiles as to us has God given a change of heart, so that they may have life.

<sup>19</sup> Then those who had gone away at the time of the trouble about Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus, preaching to the Jews only.

<sup>20</sup> But some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, when they came to Antioch, gave the good news about the Lord Jesus to the Greeks.

<sup>21</sup> And the power of the Lord was with them, and a great number had faith and were turned to the Lord.

<sup>22</sup> And news of them came to the ears of the church at Jerusalem: and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch:

<sup>23</sup> Who, when he came and saw the grace of God, was glad; and he made clear to them the need of keeping near the Lord with all the strength of their hearts:

<sup>24</sup> For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and a great number were joined to the Lord.

<sup>25</sup> Then he went on to Tarsus, looking for Saul;

<sup>26</sup> And when he had come across him, he took him to Antioch. And they were with the church there for a year, teaching the people; and the disciples were first given the name of Christians in Antioch.

<sup>27</sup> Now in those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.

<sup>28</sup> And one of them, named Agabus, said publicly through the Spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth: which came about in the time of Claudius.

<sup>29</sup> And the disciples, everyone as he was able, made a decision to send help to the brothers living in Judaea:

<sup>30</sup> Which they did, sending it to the rulers of the church by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
