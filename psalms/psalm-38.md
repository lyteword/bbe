# Psalm 38 

A Psalm. Of David. To keep in memory.

**¹** O Lord, be not bitter with me in your wrath; let not your hand be on me in the heat of your passion.

**²** For your arrows have gone into my flesh, and I am crushed under the weight of your hand.

**³** My flesh is wasted because of your wrath; and there is no peace in my bones because of my sin.

**⁴** For my crimes have gone over my head; they are like a great weight which is more than my strength.

**⁵** My wounds are poisoned and evil-smelling, because of my foolish behaviour.

**⁶** I am troubled, I am made low; I go weeping all the day.

**⁷** For my body is full of burning; all my flesh is unhealthy.

**⁸** I am feeble and crushed down; I gave a cry like a lion because of the grief in my heart.

**⁹** Lord, all my desire is before you; my sorrow is not kept secret from you.

**¹⁰** My heart goes out in pain, my strength is wasting away; as for the light of my eyes, it is gone from me.

**¹¹** My lovers and my friends keep away from my disease; my relations keep far away.

**¹²** Those who have a desire to take my life put nets for me; those who are designing my destruction say evil things against me, all the day their minds are full of deceit.

**¹³** But I kept my ears shut like a man without hearing; like a man without a voice, never opening his mouth.

**¹⁴** So I was like a man whose ears are shut, and in whose mouth there are no sharp words.

**¹⁵** In you, O Lord, is my hope: you will give me an answer, O Lord, my God.

**¹⁶** I said, Let them not be glad over me; when my foot is moved, let them not be lifted up with pride against me.

**¹⁷** My feet are near to falling, and my sorrow is ever before me.

**¹⁸** I will make clear my wrongdoing, with sorrow in my heart for my sin.

**¹⁹** But they are strong who have hate for me without cause: those who are against me falsely are increased in numbers.

**²⁰** They give me back evil for good; they are my haters because I go after the thing which is right.

**²¹** Do not give me up, O Lord; O my God, be near to me.

**²²** Come quickly to give me help, O Lord, my salvation.
