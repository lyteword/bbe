# Psalm 119

ALEPH

<sup>1</sup> Happy are they who are without sin in their ways, walking in the law of the Lord.

<sup>2</sup> Happy are they who keep his unchanging word, searching after him with all their heart.

<sup>3</sup> They do no evil; they go in his ways.

<sup>4</sup> You have put your orders into our hearts, so that we might keep them with care.

<sup>5</sup> If only my ways were ordered so that I might keep your rules!

<sup>6</sup> Then I would not be put to shame, as long as I have respect for all your teaching.

<sup>7</sup> I will give you praise with an upright heart in learning your right decisions.

<sup>8</sup> I will keep your rules: O give me not up completely.

BETH

<sup>9</sup> How may a young man make his way clean? by guiding it after your word.

<sup>10</sup> I have made search for you with all my heart: O let me not go wandering far from your teaching.

<sup>11</sup> I have kept your sayings secretly in my heart, so that I might do no sin against you.

<sup>12</sup> Praise be to you, O Lord: give me knowledge of your rules.

<sup>13</sup> With my lips have I made clear all the decisions of your mouth.

<sup>14</sup> I have taken as much delight in the way of your unchanging word, as in all wealth.

<sup>15</sup> I will give thought to your orders, and have respect for your ways.

<sup>16</sup> I will have delight in your rules; I will not let your word go out of my mind.

GIMEL

<sup>17</sup> Give me, your servant, the reward of life, so that I may keep your word;

<sup>18</sup> Let my eyes be open to see the wonders of your law.

<sup>19</sup> I am living in a strange land: do not let your teachings be kept secret from me.

<sup>20</sup> My soul is broken with desire for your decisions at all times.

<sup>21</sup> Your hand has been against the men of pride, a curse is on those who go wandering out of your way.

<sup>22</sup> Take away from me shame and bitter words; for I have kept your unchanging word in my heart.

<sup>23</sup> Rulers make evil designs against me; but your servant gives thought to your rules.

<sup>24</sup> Your unchanging word is my delight, and the guide of my footsteps.

DALETH

<sup>25</sup> My soul is joined to the dust: O give me life, in keeping with your word.

<sup>26</sup> I put the record of my ways before you, and you gave me an answer: O give me knowledge of your rules.

<sup>27</sup> Make the way of your orders clear to me; then my thoughts will be ever on your wonders.

<sup>28</sup> My soul is wasted with sorrow; give me strength again in keeping with your word

<sup>29</sup> Take from me every false way; and in mercy give me your law.

<sup>30</sup> I have taken the way of faith: I have kept your decisions before me.

<sup>31</sup> I have been true to your unchanging word; O Lord, do not put me to shame.

<sup>32</sup> I will go quickly in the way of your teaching, because you have given me a free heart.

\w HE|strong="H3588"\w*

<sup>33</sup> O Lord, let me see the way of your rules, and I will keep it to the end.

<sup>34</sup> Give me wisdom, so that I may keep your law; going after it with all my heart.

<sup>35</sup> Make me go in the way of your teachings; for they are my delight.

<sup>36</sup> Let my heart be turned to your unchanging word, and not to evil desire.

<sup>37</sup> Let my eyes be turned away from what is false; give me life in your ways.

<sup>38</sup> Give effect to your word to your servant, in whose heart is the fear of you.

<sup>39</sup> Take away the shame which is my fear; for your decisions are good.

<sup>40</sup> See how great is my desire for your orders: give me life in your righteousness.

VAU

<sup>41</sup> Let your mercies come to me, O Lord, even your salvation, as you have said.

<sup>43</sup> Take not your true word quite out of my mouth; for I have put my hope in your decisions.

<sup>44</sup> So that I may keep your law for ever and ever;

<sup>45</sup> So that my way may be in a wide place: because my search has been for your orders.

<sup>46</sup> So that I may give knowledge of your unchanging word before kings, and not be put to shame.

<sup>47</sup> And so that I may take delight in your teachings, to which I have given my love.

<sup>48</sup> And so that my hands may be stretched out to you; and I will give thought to your rules.

ZAIN

<sup>49</sup> Keep in mind your word to your servant, for on it has my hope been fixed.

<sup>51</sup> The men of pride have made great sport of me; but I have not been turned from your law.

<sup>52</sup> I have kept the memory of your decisions from times past, O Lord; and they have been my comfort.

<sup>53</sup> I am burning with wrath, because of the sinners who have given up your law.

<sup>54</sup> Your rules have been melodies to me, while I have been living in strange lands.

<sup>55</sup> I have given thought to your name in the night, O Lord, and have kept your law.

<sup>56</sup> This has been true of me, that I have kept your orders in my heart.

CHETH

<sup>57</sup> The Lord is my heritage: I have said that I would be ruled by your words.

<sup>58</sup> I have given my mind to do your pleasure with all my heart; have mercy on me, as you have said.

<sup>59</sup> I gave thought to my steps, and my feet were turned into the way of your unchanging word.

<sup>60</sup> I was quick to do your orders, and let no time be wasted.

<sup>61</sup> The cords of evil-doers are round me; but I have kept in mind your law.

<sup>62</sup> In the middle of the night I will get up to give you praise, because of all your right decisions.

<sup>63</sup> I keep company with all your worshippers, and those who have your orders in their memory.

<sup>64</sup> The earth, O Lord, is full of your mercy: give me knowledge of your rules.

<sup>72</sup> The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver.

JOD

<sup>73</sup> Your hands have made me, and given me form: give me wisdom, so that I may have knowledge of your teaching.

<sup>74</sup> Your worshippers will see me and be glad; because my hope has been in your word.

<sup>75</sup> I have seen, O Lord, that your decisions are right, and that in unchanging faith you have sent trouble on me.

<sup>76</sup> Let your mercy now be my comfort, as you have said to your servant.

<sup>77</sup> Let your gentle mercies come to me, so that I may have life; for your law is my delight.

<sup>78</sup> Let the men of pride be shamed; because they have falsely given decision against me; but I will give thought to your orders.

<sup>79</sup> Let your worshippers be turned to me, and those who have knowledge of your words.

<sup>80</sup> Let all my heart be given to your orders, so that I may not be put to shame.

CAPH

<sup>81</sup> My soul is wasted with desire for your salvation: but I have hope in your word.

<sup>82</sup> My eyes are full of weariness with searching for your word, saying, When will you give me comfort?

<sup>83</sup> For I have become like a wine-skin black with smoke; but I still keep the memory of your rules.

<sup>84</sup> How short is the life of your servant! when will you give your decision against those who are attacking me?

<sup>85</sup> The men of pride, who are turned away from your law, have put nets for me.

<sup>86</sup> All your teachings are certain; they go after me with evil design; give me your help.

<sup>87</sup> They had almost put an end to me on earth; but I did not give up your orders.

<sup>88</sup> Give me life in your mercy; so that I may be ruled by the unchanging word of your mouth.

LAMED
