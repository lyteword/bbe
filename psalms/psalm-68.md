# Psalm 68

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. Of David. A Psalm. A Song. Let God be seen, and let his haters be put to flight; let those who are against him be turned back before him. 

<sup>2</sup> Let them be like smoke before the driving wind; as wax turning soft before the fire, so let them come to an end before the power of God. 

<sup>3</sup> But let the upright be glad; let them have delight before God; let them be full of joy. 

<sup>4</sup> Make songs to God, make songs of praise to his name; make a way for him who comes through the waste lands; his name is Jah; be glad before him. 

<sup>5</sup> A father to those who have no father, a judge of the widows, is God in his holy place. 

<sup>6</sup> Those who are without friends, God puts in families; he makes free those who are in chains; but those who are turned away from him are given a dry land. 

<sup>7</sup> O God, when you went out before your people, wandering through the waste land; (Selah.) 

<sup>8</sup> The earth was shaking and the heavens were streaming, because God was present; even Sinai itself was moved before God, the God of Israel. 

<sup>9</sup> You, O God, did freely send the rain, giving strength to the weariness of your heritage. 

<sup>10</sup> Those whose resting-place was there, even the poor, were comforted by your good things, O God. 

<sup>11</sup> The Lord gives the word; great is the number of the women who make it public. 

<sup>12</sup> Kings of armies quickly go in flight: and the women in the houses make a division of their goods. 

<sup>13</sup> Will you take your rest among the flocks? like the wings of a dove covered with silver, and its feathers with yellow gold. 

<sup>14</sup> When the Most High put the kings to flight, it was as white as snow in Salmon. 

<sup>15</sup> A hill of God is the hill of Bashan; a hill with high tops is the hill of Bashan. 

<sup>16</sup> Why are you looking with envy, you high hills, on the hill desired by God as his resting-place? truly, God will make it his house for ever. 

<sup>17</sup> The war-carriage of God is among Israel's thousands; the Lord has come from Sinai to the holy place. 

<sup>18</sup> You have gone up on high, taking your prisoners with you; you have taken offerings from men; the Lord God has taken his place on the seat of his power. 

<sup>19</sup> Praise be to the Lord, who is our support day by day, even the God of our salvation. (Selah.) 

<sup>20</sup> Our God is for us a God of salvation; his are the ways out of death. 

<sup>21</sup> The heads of the haters of God will be crushed; even the head of him who still goes on in his evil ways. 

<sup>22</sup> The Lord said, I will make them come back from Bashan, and from the deep parts of the sea; 

<sup>23</sup> So that your foot may be red with blood, and the tongues of your dogs with the same. 

<sup>24</sup> We see your going, O God: even the going of my God, my King, into the holy place. 

<sup>25</sup> The makers of songs go before, the players of music come after, among the young girls playing on brass instruments. 

<sup>26</sup> Give praise to God in the great meeting; even the Lord, you who come from the fountain of Israel. 

<sup>27</sup> There is little Benjamin ruling them, the chiefs of Judah and their army, the rulers of Zebulun and the rulers of Naphtali. 

<sup>28</sup> O God, send out your strength; the strength, O God, with which you have done great things for us, 

<sup>29</sup> Out of your Temple in Jerusalem. 

<sup>30</sup> Say sharp words to the beast among the water-plants, the band of strong ones, with the lords of the peoples, put an end to the people whose delight is in war. 

<sup>31</sup> Kings will give you offerings, they will come out of Egypt; from Pathros will come offerings of silver; Ethiopia will be stretching out her hands to God. 

<sup>32</sup> Make songs to God, you kingdoms of the earth; O make songs of praise to the Lord; (Selah.) 

<sup>33</sup> To him who goes or the clouds of heaven, the heaven which was from earliest times; he sends out his voice of power. 

<sup>34</sup> Make clear that strength is God's: he is lifted up over Israel, and his power is in the clouds. 

<sup>35</sup> O God, you are to be feared in your holy place: the God of Israel gives strength and power to his people. Praise be to God.
