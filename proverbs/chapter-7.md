# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> My son, keep my sayings, and let my rules be stored up with you.

<sup>2</sup> Keep my rules and you will have life; let my teaching be to you as the light of your eyes;

<sup>3</sup> Let them be fixed to your fingers, and recorded in your heart.

<sup>4</sup> Say to wisdom, You are my sister; let knowledge be named your special friend:

<sup>5</sup> So that they may keep you from the strange woman, even from her whose words are smooth.

<sup>6</sup> Looking out from my house, and watching through the window,

<sup>7</sup> I saw among the young men one without sense,

<sup>8</sup> Walking in the street near the turn of her road, going on the way to her house,

<sup>9</sup> At nightfall, in the evening of the day, in the black dark of the night.

<sup>10</sup> And the woman came out to him, in the dress of a loose woman, with a designing heart;

<sup>11</sup> She is full of noise and uncontrolled; her feet keep not in her house.

<sup>12</sup> Now she is in the street, now in the open spaces, waiting at every turning of the road.

<sup>13</sup> So she took him by his hand, kissing him, and without a sign of shame she said to him:

<sup>14</sup> I have a feast of peace-offerings, for today my oaths have been effected.

<sup>15</sup> So I came out in the hope of meeting you, looking for you with care, and now I have you.

<sup>16</sup> My bed is covered with cushions of needlework, with coloured cloths of the cotton thread of Egypt;

<sup>17</sup> I have made my bed sweet with perfumes and spices.

<sup>18</sup> Come, let us take our pleasure in love till the morning, having joy in love's delights.

<sup>19</sup> For the master of the house is away on a long journey:

<sup>20</sup> He has taken a bag of money with him; he is coming back at the full moon.

<sup>21</sup> With her fair words she overcame him, forcing him with her smooth lips.

<sup>22</sup> The simple man goes after her, like an ox going to its death, like a roe pulled by a cord;

<sup>23</sup> Like a bird falling into a net; with no thought that his life is in danger, till an arrow goes into his side.

<sup>24</sup> So now, my sons, give ear to me; give attention to the sayings of my mouth;

<sup>25</sup> Let not your heart be turned to her ways, do not go wandering in her footsteps.

<sup>26</sup> For those wounded and made low by her are great in number; and all those who have come to their death through her are a great army.

<sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to the underworld, going down to the rooms of death.
