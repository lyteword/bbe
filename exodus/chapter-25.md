# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> Say to the children of Israel that they are to make me an offering; from every man who has the impulse in his heart take an offering for me. 

<sup>3</sup> And this is the offering you are to take from them: gold and silver and brass; 

<sup>4</sup> And blue and purple and red, and the best linen, and goats' hair; 

<sup>5</sup> And sheepskins coloured red, and leather, and hard wood; 

<sup>6</sup> Oil for the light, spices for the sweet-smelling oil, sweet perfumes for burning; 

<sup>7</sup> Beryls and stones of value to be put on the ephod and on the priest's bag. 

<sup>8</sup> And let them make me a holy place, so that I may be ever present among them. 

<sup>9</sup> Make the House and everything in it from the designs which I will give you. 

<sup>10</sup> And they are to make an ark of hard wood; two and a half cubits long, and a cubit and a half wide and high. 

<sup>11</sup> It is to be plated inside and out with the best gold, with an edge of gold all round it 

<sup>12</sup> And make four rings of gold for it, to be fixed on its four feet, two rings on one side of it and two on the other. 

<sup>13</sup> And make rods of the same wood, plating them with gold. 

<sup>14</sup> And put the rods through the rings at the sides of the ark, for lifting it. 

<sup>15</sup> The rods are to be kept in the rings, and never taken out. 

<sup>16</sup> Inside the ark you are to put the record which I will give you. 

<sup>17</sup> And you are to make a cover of the best gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 

<sup>18</sup> And at the two ends of the cover you are to make two winged ones of hammered gold, 

<sup>19</sup> One at one end and one at the other; the winged ones are to be part of the cover. 

<sup>20</sup> And their wings are to be outstretched over the cover, and the winged ones are to be opposite one another, facing the cover. 

<sup>21</sup> And put the cover over the ark, and in the ark the record which I will give you. 

<sup>22</sup> And there, between the two winged ones on the cover of the ark, I will come to you, face to face, and make clear to you all the orders I have to give you for the children of Israel. 

<sup>23</sup> And you are to make a table of the same wood, two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high, 

<sup>24</sup> Plated with the best gold, with a gold edge all round it; 

<sup>25</sup> And make a frame all round it, as wide as a man's hand, with a gold edge to the frame. 

<sup>26</sup> And make four gold rings and put them at the four angles, on the four feet of the table; 

<sup>27</sup> The rings are to be fixed under the frame to take the rods with which the table is to be lifted. 

<sup>28</sup> Make rods of the same wood, plated with gold, for lifting the table. 

<sup>29</sup> And make the table-vessels, the spoons and the cups and the basins for liquids, all of the best gold. 

<sup>30</sup> And on the table at all times you are to keep my holy bread. 

<sup>31</sup> And you are to make a support for lights, of the best gold; its base and its pillar are to be of hammered gold; its cups, its buds, and its flowers are to be made of the same metal. 

<sup>32</sup> It is to have six branches coming out from its sides; three branches from one side and three from the other. 

<sup>33</sup> Every branch having three cups made like almond flowers, every cup with a bud and a flower, on all the branches. 

<sup>34</sup> And on the pillar, four cups like almond flowers, every one with its bud and its flower: 

<sup>35</sup> And under every two branches a bud, made with the branch, for all the six branches of it. 

<sup>36</sup> The buds and the branches are to be made of the same metal; all together one complete work of hammered gold. 

<sup>37</sup> Then you are to make its seven vessels for the lights, putting them in their place so that they give light in front of it. 

<sup>38</sup> And the instruments and trays for use with it are all to be of the best gold. 

<sup>39</sup> A talent of gold will be needed for it, with all these vessels. 

<sup>40</sup> And see that you make them from the design which you saw on the mountain.
