# Psalm 53

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker; put to Mahalath. Maschil. Of David. The foolish man has said in his heart, God will not do anything. They are unclean, they have done evil works; there is not one who does good. 

<sup>2</sup> God was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God. 

<sup>3</sup> Every one of them has gone back; they are unclean: there is not one who does good, no, not one. 

<sup>4</sup> Have the workers of evil no knowledge? they take my people for food, as they would take bread; they make no prayer to God. 

<sup>5</sup> They were in great fear, where there was no cause for fear: for the bones of those who make war on you have been broken by God; you have put them to shame, because God has no desire for them. 

<sup>6</sup> May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! When the fate of his people is changed by God, Jacob will have joy, and Israel will be glad.
