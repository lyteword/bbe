# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> The evil man goes running away when no man is after him, but the upright are without fear, like the lion. 

<sup>2</sup> Because of the sin of the land, its troubles are increased; but by a man of wisdom and knowledge they will be put out like a fire. 

<sup>3</sup> A man of wealth who is cruel to the poor is like a violent rain causing destruction of food. 

<sup>4</sup> Those who have no respect for the law give praise to the evil-doer; but such as keep the law are against him. 

<sup>5</sup> Evil men have no knowledge of what is right; but those who go after the Lord have knowledge of all things. 

<sup>6</sup> Better is the poor man whose ways are upright, than the man of wealth whose ways are not straight. 

<sup>7</sup> He who keeps the law is a wise son, but he who keeps company with feasters puts shame on his father. 

<sup>8</sup> He who makes his wealth greater by taking interest, only gets it together for him who has pity on the poor. 

<sup>9</sup> As for the man whose ear is turned away from hearing the law, even his prayer is disgusting. 

<sup>10</sup> Anyone causing the upright to go wandering in an evil way, will himself go down into the hole he has made; but the upright will have good things for their heritage. 

<sup>11</sup> The man of wealth seems to himself to be wise, but the poor man who has sense has a low opinion of him. 

<sup>12</sup> When the upright do well, there is great glory; but when evil-doers are lifted up, men do not let themselves be seen. 

<sup>13</sup> He who keeps his sins secret will not do well; but one who is open about them, and gives them up, will get mercy. 

<sup>14</sup> Happy is the man in whom is the fear of the Lord at all times; but he whose heart is hard will come into trouble. 

<sup>15</sup> Like a loud-voiced lion and a wandering bear, is an evil ruler over a poor people. 

<sup>16</sup> The prince who has no sense is a cruel ruler; but he who has no desire to get profit for himself will have long life. 

<sup>17</sup> One who has been the cause of a man's death will go in flight to the underworld: let no man give him help. 

<sup>18</sup> He whose ways are upright will be safe, but sudden will be the fall of him whose ways are twisted. 

<sup>19</sup> By ploughing his land a man will have bread in full measure; but he who goes after good-for-nothing persons will be poor enough. 

<sup>20</sup> A man of good faith will have great blessing, but one attempting to get wealth quickly will not go free from punishment. 

<sup>21</sup> It is not good to have respect for a man's position: for a man will do wrong for a bit of bread. 

<sup>22</sup> He who is ever desiring wealth goes running after money, and does not see that need will come on him. 

<sup>23</sup> He who says words of protest to a man will later have more approval than one who says smooth words with his tongue. 

<sup>24</sup> He who takes from his father or his mother what is theirs by right, and says, It is no sin; is the same as a taker of life. 

<sup>25</sup> He who is ever desiring profit is a cause of fighting; but he who puts his faith in the Lord will be made fat. 

<sup>26</sup> He whose faith is in himself is foolish; but everyone walking wisely will be kept safe. 

<sup>27</sup> He who gives to the poor will never be in need, but great curses will be on him who gives no attention to them. 

<sup>28</sup> When evil-doers are lifted up, men take cover; but when destruction overtakes them, the upright are increased.
