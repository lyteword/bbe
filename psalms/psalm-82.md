# Psalm 82 

A Psalm. Of Asaph.

**¹** God is in the meeting-place of God; he is judging among the gods.

**²** How long will you go on judging falsely, having respect for the persons of evil-doers? (Selah.)

**³** Give ear to the cause of the poor and the children without fathers; let those who are troubled and in need have their rights.

**⁴** Be the saviour of the poor and those who have nothing: take them out of the hand of the evil-doers.

**⁵** They have no knowledge or sense; they go about in the dark: all the bases of the earth are moved.

**⁶** I said, You are gods; all of you are the sons of the Most High:

**⁷** But you will come to death like men, falling like one of the rulers of the earth.

**⁸** Up! O God, come as judge of the earth; for all the nations are your heritage.
