# Psalm 119

<sup>1</sup> ALEPH Happy are they who are without sin in their ways, walking in the law of the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> Happy are they who keep his unchanging word, searching after him with all their heart. 

<sup>3</sup> They do no evil; they go in his ways. 

<sup>4</sup> You have put your orders into our hearts, so that we might keep them with care. 

<sup>5</sup> If only my ways were ordered so that I might keep your rules! 

<sup>6</sup> Then I would not be put to shame, as long as I have respect for all your teaching. 

<sup>7</sup> I will give you praise with an upright heart in learning your right decisions. 

<sup>8</sup> I will keep your rules: O give me not up completely. 

<sup>9</sup> BETH How may a young man make his way clean? by guiding it after your word. 

<sup>10</sup> I have made search for you with all my heart: O let me not go wandering far from your teaching. 

<sup>11</sup> I have kept your sayings secretly in my heart, so that I might do no sin against you. 

<sup>12</sup> Praise be to you, O Lord: give me knowledge of your rules. 

<sup>13</sup> With my lips have I made clear all the decisions of your mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> I have taken as much delight in the way of your unchanging word, as in all wealth. 

<sup>15</sup> I will give thought to your orders, and have respect for your ways. 

<sup>16</sup> I will have delight in your rules; I will not let your word go out of my mind. 

<sup>17</sup> GIMEL Give me, your servant, the reward of life, so that I may keep your word; 

<sup>18</sup> Let my eyes be open to see the wonders of your law. 

<sup>19</sup> I am living in a strange land: do not let your teachings be kept secret from me. 

<sup>20</sup> My soul is broken with desire for your decisions at all times. 

<sup>21</sup> Your hand has been against the men of pride, a curse is on those who go wandering out of your way. 

<sup>22</sup> Take away from me shame and bitter words; for I have kept your unchanging word in my heart. 

<sup>23</sup> Rulers make evil designs against me; but your servant gives thought to your rules. 

<sup>24</sup> Your unchanging word is my delight, and the guide of my footsteps. 

<sup>25</sup> DALETH My soul is joined to the dust: O give me life, in keeping with your word. 

<sup>26</sup> I put the record of my ways before you, and you gave me an answer: O give me knowledge of your rules. 

<sup>27</sup> Make the way of your orders clear to me; then my thoughts will be ever on your wonders. 

<sup>28</sup> My soul is wasted with sorrow; give me strength again in keeping with your word 

<sup>29</sup> Take from me every false way; and in mercy give me your law. 

<sup>30</sup> I have taken the way of faith: I have kept your decisions before me. 

<sup>31</sup> I have been true to your unchanging word; O Lord, do not put me to shame. 

<sup>32</sup> I will go quickly in the way of your teaching, because you have given me a free heart. 

<sup>33</sup> HE O Lord, let me see the way of your rules, and I will keep it to the end. 

<sup>34</sup> Give me wisdom, so that I may keep your law; going after it with all my heart. 

<sup>35</sup> Make me go in the way of your teachings; for they are my delight. 

<sup>36</sup> Let my heart be turned to your unchanging word, and not to evil desire. 

<sup>37</sup> Let my eyes be turned away from what is false; give me life in your ways. 

<sup>38</sup> Give effect to your word to your servant, in whose heart is the fear of you. 

<sup>39</sup> Take away the shame which is my fear; for your decisions are good. 

<sup>40</sup> See how great is my desire for your orders: give me life in your righteousness. 

<sup>41</sup> VAU Let your mercies come to me, O Lord, even your salvation, as you have said. 

<sup>42</sup> So that I may have an answer for the man who would put me to shame; for I have faith in your word. 

<sup>43</sup> Take not your true word quite out of my mouth; for I have put my hope in your decisions. 

<sup>44</sup> So that I may keep your law for ever and ever; 

<sup>45</sup> So that my way may be in a wide place: because my search has been for your orders. 

<sup>46</sup> So that I may give knowledge of your unchanging word before kings, and not be put to shame. 

<sup>47</sup> And so that I may take delight in your teachings, to which I have given my love. 

<sup>48</sup> And so that my hands may be stretched out to you; and I will give thought to your rules. 

<sup>49</sup> ZAIN Keep in mind your word to your servant, for on it has my hope been fixed. 

<sup>50</sup> This is my comfort in my trouble; that your sayings have given me life. 

<sup>51</sup> The men of pride have made great sport of me; but I have not been turned from your law. 

<sup>52</sup> I have kept the memory of your decisions from times past, O Lord; and they have been my comfort. 

<sup>53</sup> I am burning with wrath, because of the sinners who have given up your law. 

<sup>54</sup> Your rules have been melodies to me, while I have been living in strange lands. 

<sup>55</sup> I have given thought to your name in the night, O Lord, and have kept your law. 

<sup>56</sup> This has been true of me, that I have kept your orders in my heart. 

<sup>57</sup> CHETH The Lord is my heritage: I have said that I would be ruled by your words. 

<sup>58</sup> I have given my mind to do your pleasure with all my heart; have mercy on me, as you have said. 

<sup>59</sup> I gave thought to my steps, and my feet were turned into the way of your unchanging word. 

<sup>60</sup> I was quick to do your orders, and let no time be wasted. 

<sup>61</sup> The cords of evil-doers are round me; but I have kept in mind your law. 

<sup>62</sup> In the middle of the night I will get up to give you praise, because of all your right decisions. 

<sup>63</sup> I keep company with all your worshippers, and those who have your orders in their memory. 

<sup>64</sup> The earth, O Lord, is full of your mercy: give me knowledge of your rules. 

<sup>65</sup> TETH You have done good to your servant, O Lord, in keeping with your word. 

<sup>66</sup> Give me knowledge and good sense; for I have put my faith in your teachings. 

<sup>67</sup> Before I was in trouble I went out of the way; but now I keep your word. 

<sup>68</sup> You are good, and your works are good; give me knowledge of your rules. 

<sup>69</sup> The men of pride have said false things about me; but I will keep your orders in my heart. 

<sup>70</sup> Their hearts are shut up with fat; but my delight is in your law. 

<sup>71</sup> It is good for me to have been through trouble; so that I might come to the knowledge of your rules. 

<sup>72</sup> The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver. 

<sup>73</sup> JOD Your hands have made me, and given me form: give me wisdom, so that I may have knowledge of your teaching. 

<sup>74</sup> Your worshippers will see me and be glad; because my hope has been in your word. 

<sup>75</sup> I have seen, O Lord, that your decisions are right, and that in unchanging faith you have sent trouble on me. 

<sup>76</sup> Let your mercy now be my comfort, as you have said to your servant. 

<sup>77</sup> Let your gentle mercies come to me, so that I may have life; for your law is my delight. 

<sup>78</sup> Let the men of pride be shamed; because they have falsely given decision against me; but I will give thought to your orders. 

<sup>79</sup> Let your worshippers be turned to me, and those who have knowledge of your words. 

<sup>80</sup> Let all my heart be given to your orders, so that I may not be put to shame. 

<sup>81</sup> CAPH My soul is wasted with desire for your salvation: but I have hope in your word. 

<sup>82</sup> My eyes are full of weariness with searching for your word, saying, When will you give me comfort? 

<sup>83</sup> For I have become like a wine-skin black with smoke; but I still keep the memory of your rules. 

<sup>84</sup> How short is the life of your servant! when will you give your decision against those who are attacking me? 

<sup>85</sup> The men of pride, who are turned away from your law, have put nets for me. 

<sup>86</sup> All your teachings are certain; they go after me with evil design; give me your help. 

<sup>87</sup> They had almost put an end to me on earth; but I did not give up your orders. 

<sup>88</sup> Give me life in your mercy; so that I may be ruled by the unchanging word of your mouth. 

<sup>89</sup> LAMED For ever, O Lord, your word is fixed in heaven. 

<sup>90</sup> Your faith is unchanging from generation to generation: you have put the earth in its place, and it is not moved. 

<sup>91</sup> They are ruled this day by your decisions; for all things are your servants. 

<sup>92</sup> If your law had not been my delight, my troubles would have put an end to me. 

<sup>93</sup> I will ever keep your orders in mind; for in them I have life. 

<sup>94</sup> I am yours, O be my saviour; for my desire has been for your rules. 

<sup>95</sup> The sinners have been waiting for me to give me up to destruction; but I will give all my mind to your unchanging ward. 

<sup>96</sup> I have seen that nothing on earth is complete; but your teaching is very wide. 

<sup>97</sup> MEM O what love I have for your law! I give thought to it all the day. 

<sup>98</sup> Your teaching has made me wiser than my haters: for it is mine for ever. 

<sup>99</sup> I have more knowledge than all my teachers, because I give thought to your unchanging word. 

<sup>100</sup> I have more wisdom than the old, because I have kept your orders. 

<sup>101</sup> I have kept back my feet from all evil ways, so that I might be true to your word. 

<sup>102</sup> My heart has not been turned away from your decisions; for you have been my teacher. 

<sup>103</sup> How sweet are your sayings to my taste! truly, they are sweeter than honey in my mouth! 

<sup>104</sup> Through your orders I get wisdom; for this reason I am a hater of every false way. 

<sup>105</sup> NUN Your word is a light for my feet, ever shining on my way. 

<sup>106</sup> I have made an oath and kept it, to be guided by your upright decisions. 

<sup>107</sup> I am greatly troubled, O Lord, give me life in keeping with your word. 

<sup>108</sup> Take, O Lord, the free offerings of my mouth, and give me knowledge of your decisions. 

<sup>109</sup> My soul is ever in danger; but I still keep the memory of your law. 

<sup>110</sup> Sinners have put a net to take me; but I was true to your orders. 

<sup>111</sup> I have taken your unchanging word as an eternal heritage; for it is the joy of my heart. 

<sup>112</sup> My heart is ever ready to keep your rules, even to the end. 

<sup>113</sup> SAMECH I am a hater of men of doubting mind; but I am a lover of your law. 

<sup>114</sup> You are my secret place and my breastplate against danger; my hope is in your word. 

<sup>115</sup> Go far from me, you evil-doers; so that I may keep the teachings of my God. 

<sup>116</sup> Be my support as you have said, and give me life; let not my hope be turned to shame. 

<sup>117</sup> Let me not be moved, and I will be safe, and ever take delight in your rules. 

<sup>118</sup> You have overcome all those who are wandering from your rules; for all their thoughts are false. 

<sup>119</sup> All the sinners of the earth are like waste metal in your eyes; and for this cause I give my love to your unchanging word. 

<sup>120</sup> My flesh is moved for fear of you; I give honour to your decisions. 

<sup>121</sup> AIN I have done what is good and right: you will not give me into the hands of those who are working against me. 

<sup>122</sup> Take your servant's interests into your keeping; let me not be crushed by the men of pride. 

<sup>123</sup> My eyes are wasted with desire for your salvation, and for the word of your righteousness. 

<sup>124</sup> Be good to your servant in your mercy, and give me teaching in your rules. 

<sup>125</sup> I am your servant; give me wisdom, so that I may have knowledge of your unchanging word. 

<sup>126</sup> It is time, O Lord, for you to let your work be seen; for they have made your law without effect. 

<sup>127</sup> For this reason I have greater love far your teachings than for gold, even for shining gold. 

<sup>128</sup> Because of it I keep straight in all things by your orders; and I am a hater of every false way. 

<sup>129</sup> PE Your unchanging word is full of wonder; for this reason my soul keeps it. 

<sup>130</sup> The opening of your words gives light; it gives good sense to the simple. 

<sup>131</sup> My mouth was open wide, waiting with great desire for your teachings. 

<sup>132</sup> Let your eyes be turned to me, and have mercy on me, as it is right for you to do to those who are lovers of your name. 

<sup>133</sup> Let my steps be guided by your word; and let not sin have control over me. 

<sup>134</sup> Make me free from the cruel rule of man; then I will keep your orders. 

<sup>135</sup> Let your servant see the shining of your face; give me knowledge of your rules. 

<sup>136</sup> Rivers of water are flowing from my eyes, because men do not keep your law. 

<sup>137</sup> TZADE O Lord, great is your righteousness, and upright are your decisions. 

<sup>138</sup> You have given your unchanging word in righteousness, and it is for ever. 

<sup>139</sup> My passion has overcome me; because my haters are turned away from your words. 

<sup>140</sup> Your word is of tested value; and it is dear to your servant. 

<sup>141</sup> I am small and of no account; but I keep your orders in mind. 

<sup>142</sup> Your righteousness is an unchanging righteousness, and your law is certain. 

<sup>143</sup> Pain and trouble have overcome me: but your teachings are my delight. 

<sup>144</sup> The righteousness of your unchanging word is eternal; give me wisdom so that I may have life. 

<sup>145</sup> KOPH I have made my prayer with all my heart; give answer to me, O Lord: I will keep your rules.

<sup>148</sup> In the night watches I am awake, so that I may give thought to your saying. 

<sup>149</sup> Let my voice come to you, in your mercy; O Lord, by your decisions give me life. 

<sup>150</sup> Those who have evil designs against me come near; they are far from your law. 

<sup>151</sup> You are near, O Lord; and all your teachings are true. 

<sup>152</sup> I have long had knowledge that your unchanging word is for ever. 

<sup>153</sup> RESH O see my trouble, and be my saviour; for I keep your law in my mind, 

<sup>154</sup> Undertake my cause, and come to my help, give me life, as you have said. 

<sup>155</sup> Salvation is far from evil-doers; for they have made no search for your rules. 

<sup>156</sup> Great is the number of your mercies, O Lord; give me life in keeping with your decisions. 

<sup>157</sup> Great is the number of those who are against me; but I have not been turned away from your unchanging word. 

<sup>158</sup> I saw with hate those who were untrue to you; for they did not keep your saying. 

<sup>159</sup> See how great is my love for your orders: give me life, O Lord, in keeping with your mercy. 

<sup>160</sup> Your word is true from the first; and your upright decision is unchanging for ever. 

<sup>161</sup> SHIN Rulers have been cruel to me without cause; but I have the fear of your word in my heart. 

<sup>162</sup> I am delighted by your saying, like a man who makes discovery of great wealth. 

<sup>163</sup> I am full of hate and disgust for false words; but I am a lover of your law. 

<sup>164</sup> Seven times a day do I give you praise, because of your upright decisions.

<sup>171</sup> Let my lips be flowing with praise, because you have given me knowledge of your rules. 

<sup>172</sup> Let my tongue make songs in praise of your word; for all your teachings are righteousness.
