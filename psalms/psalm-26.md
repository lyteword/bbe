# Psalm 26

<sup>1</sup> Of David. O Lord, be my judge, for my behaviour has been upright: I have put my faith in the Lord, I am not in danger of slipping. 

<sup>2</sup> Put me in the scales, O Lord, so that I may be tested; let the fire make clean my thoughts and my heart. 

<sup>3</sup> For your mercy is before my eyes; and I have gone in the way of your good faith. 

<sup>4</sup> I have not taken my seat with foolish persons, and I do not go with false men. 

<sup>5</sup> I have been a hater of the band of wrongdoers, and I will not be seated among sinners. 

<sup>6</sup> I will make my hands clean from sin; so will I go round your altar, O Lord; 

<sup>7</sup> That I may give out the voice of praise, and make public all the wonders which you have done. 

<sup>8</sup> Lord, your house has been dear to me, and the resting-place of your glory. 

<sup>9</sup> Let not my soul be numbered among sinners, or my life among men of blood; 

<sup>10</sup> In whose hands are evil designs, and whose right hands take money for judging falsely. 

<sup>11</sup> But as for me, I will go on in my upright ways: be my saviour, and have mercy on me. 

<sup>12</sup> I have a safe resting-place for my feet; I will give praise to the Lord in the meetings of the people.
