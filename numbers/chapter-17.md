# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> Say to the children of Israel that they are to give you rods, one for every family, for every chief, the head of his father's house, making twelve rods; let every man's name be placed on his rod. 

<sup>3</sup> And let Aaron's name be placed on the rod of Levi: for there is to be one rod for the head of every family. 

<sup>4</sup> And let them be stored up in the Tent of meeting, in front of the ark of witness where I come to you. 

<sup>5</sup> And the rod of that man who is marked out by me for myself will have buds on it; so I will put a stop to the outcries which the children of Israel make to me against you. 

<sup>6</sup> So Moses gave these orders to the children of Israel, and all their chiefs gave him rods, one for the head of every family, making twelve rods: and Aaron's rod was among them. 

<sup>7</sup> And Moses put the rods before the Lord in the Tent of witness. 

<sup>8</sup> Now on the day after, Moses went into the Tent of witness; and he saw that Aaron's rod, the rod of the house of Levi, had put out buds, and was covered with buds and flowers and fruit. 

<sup>9</sup> Then Moses took out all the rods from before the Lord, and gave them back to the children of Israel: and they saw them, and every man took his rod. 

<sup>10</sup> And the Lord said to Moses, Put Aaron's rod back in front of the ark of witness, to be kept for a sign against this false-hearted people, so that you may put a stop to their outcries against me, and death may not overtake them. 

<sup>11</sup> This Moses did: as the Lord gave orders, so he did. 

<sup>12</sup> And the children of Israel said to Moses, Truly, destruction has come on us; an evil fate has overtaken us all. 

<sup>13</sup> Death will overtake everyone who comes near, who comes near the House of the Lord: are we all to come to destruction?
