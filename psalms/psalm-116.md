# Psalm 116

<sup>1</sup> I have given my love to the Lord, because he has given ear to the voice of my cry and my prayer.

<sup>2</sup> He has let my request come before him, and I will make my prayer to him all my days.

<sup>3</sup> The nets of death were round me, and the pains of the underworld had me in their grip; I was full of trouble and sorrow.

<sup>4</sup> Then I made my prayer to the Lord, saying, O Lord, take my soul out of trouble.

<sup>5</sup> The Lord is full of grace and righteousness; truly, he is a God of mercy.

<sup>6</sup> The Lord keeps the simple; I was made low, and he was my saviour.

<sup>7</sup> Come back to your rest, O my soul; for the Lord has given you your reward.

<sup>8</sup> You have taken my soul from the power of death, keeping my eyes from weeping, and my feet from falling.

<sup>9</sup> I will go before the Lord in the land of the living.

<sup>10</sup> I still had faith, though I said, I am in great trouble;

<sup>11</sup> Though I said in my fear, All men are false.

<sup>12</sup> What may I give to the Lord for all the good things which he has done for me?

<sup>13</sup> I will take the cup of salvation, and give praise to the name of the Lord.

<sup>14</sup> I will make the offering of my oath to the Lord, even before all his people.

<sup>15</sup> Dear in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his saints.

<sup>16</sup> O Lord, truly I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of her who is your servant; by you have my cords been broken.

<sup>17</sup> I will give an offering of praise to you, and make my prayer in the name of the Lord.

<sup>18</sup> I will make the offerings of my oath, even before all his people;

<sup>19</sup> In the Lord's house, even in Jerusalem. Praise be to the Lord.
