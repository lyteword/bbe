# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> And David made a song to the Lord in these words, on the day when the Lord made him free from the hands of all his haters, and from the hand of Saul: 

<sup>2</sup> And he said, The Lord is my Rock, my walled town, and my saviour, even mine; 

<sup>3</sup> My God, my Rock, in him will I put my faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my safe place; my saviour, who keeps me safe from the violent man. 

<sup>4</sup> I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me. 

<sup>5</sup> For the waves of death came round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear; 

<sup>6</sup> The cords of hell were round me: the nets of death came on me. 

<sup>7</sup> In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came to his ears. 

<sup>8</sup> Then the earth was moved with a violent shock; the bases of heaven were moved and shaking, because he was angry. 

<sup>9</sup> There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth: coals were lighted by it. 

<sup>10</sup> The heavens were bent, so that he might come down; and it was dark under his feet. 

<sup>11</sup> And he went through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind. 

<sup>12</sup> And he made the dark his tent round him, a mass of waters, thick clouds of the skies. 

<sup>13</sup> Before his shining light his dark clouds went past, raining ice and coals of fire. 

<sup>14</sup> The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding out. 

<sup>15</sup> And he sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled. 

<sup>16</sup> Then the deep beds of the sea were seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of the Lord's wrath, because of the breath of his mouth. 

<sup>17</sup> He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters. 

<sup>18</sup> He made me free from my strong hater, from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I. 

<sup>19</sup> They came on me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my support. 

<sup>20</sup> He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in me. 

<sup>21</sup> The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean before him. 

<sup>22</sup> For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not been turned away in sin from my God. 

<sup>23</sup> For all his decisions were before me, and I did not put away his laws from me. 

<sup>24</sup> And I was upright before him, and I kept myself from sin. 

<sup>25</sup> Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes. 

<sup>26</sup> On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright; 

<sup>27</sup> He who is holy will see that you are holy; but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge. 

<sup>28</sup> For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble; but your eyes are on men of pride, to make them low. 

<sup>29</sup> For you are my light, O Lord; and the Lord will make the dark bright for me. 

<sup>30</sup> By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in: by the help of my God I have gone over a wall. 

<sup>31</sup> As for God, his way is all good: the word of the Lord is tested; he is a safe cover for all those who put their faith in him. 

<sup>32</sup> For who is God but the Lord? and who is a Rock but our God? 

<sup>33</sup> God puts a strong band about me, guiding me in a straight way. 

<sup>34</sup> He makes my feet like roes' feet, and puts me on high places. 

<sup>35</sup> He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms. 

<sup>36</sup> You have given me the breastplate of your salvation, and your mercy has made me great. 

<sup>37</sup> You have made my steps wide under me, so that my feet make no slip. 

<sup>38</sup> I go after my haters and overtake them; not turning back till they are all overcome. 

<sup>39</sup> I have sent destruction on them and given them wounds, so that they are not able to get up: they are stretched under my feet. 

<sup>40</sup> For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who came out against me. 

<sup>41</sup> By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off. 

<sup>42</sup> They were crying out, but there was no one to come to their help: even to the Lord, but he gave them no answer. 

<sup>43</sup> Then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth, stamped down under my feet like the waste of the streets. 

<sup>44</sup> You have made me free from the fightings of my people; you have made me the head of the nations: a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants. 

<sup>45</sup> Men of other countries will, with false hearts, put themselves under my authority: from the time when my name comes to their ears, they will be ruled by me. 

<sup>46</sup> They will be wasted away, they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear. 

<sup>47</sup> The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured: 

<sup>48</sup> It is God who sends punishment on my haters, and puts peoples under my rule. 

<sup>49</sup> He makes me free from my haters: I am lifted up over those who come up against me: you have made me free from the violent man. 

<sup>50</sup> Because of this I will give you praise, O Lord, among the nations, and will make a song of praise to your name. 

<sup>51</sup> Great salvation does he give to his king; he has mercy on the king of his selection, David, and on his seed for ever.
