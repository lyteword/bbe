**⁹** And Jabez was honoured more than his brothers; but his mother had given him the name Jabez, saying, Because I gave birth to him with sorrow.

**¹⁰** And Jabez made a prayer to the God of Israel, saying, If only you would truly give me a blessing, and make wider the limits of my land, and let your hand be with me, and keep me from evil, so that I may not be troubled by it! And God gave him his desire.

**¹¹** And Chelub, the brother of Shuhah, was the father of Mehir, who was the father of Eshton.

**²²** And Jokim, and the men of Cozeba, and Joash and Saraph, who were rulers in Moab, and went back to Beth-lehem. And the records are very old.

**²³** These were the potters, and the people living among planted fields with walls round them; they were there to do the king's work.

**²⁴** The sons of Simeon: Nemuel and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, Shaul;

**²⁵** Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, Mishma his son.

**²⁶** And the sons of Mishma: Hammuel his son, Zaccur his son, Shimei his son.

**²⁷** And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his brothers had only a small number of children, and their family was not as fertile as the children of Judah.

**²⁸** And they were living at Beer-sheba and Moladah and Hazar-shual,

**²⁹** And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,

**³⁰** And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag,

**³²** And their small towns were Etam, Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen and Ashan, five towns;

**³³** And all the small places round these towns, as far as Baalath-beer, the high place of the South. These were their living-places, and they have lists of their generations.

**³⁹** And they went to the opening into Gedor, as far as the east side of the valley, in search of grass-land for their flocks.

**⁴⁰** And they came to some good fertile grass-land, in a wide quiet country of peace-loving people; for the people who were living there before were of the offspring of Ham.

**⁴¹** And these whose names are given came in the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and made an attack on the Meunim who were living there, and put an end to them to this day, and took their place, because there was grass there for their flocks.

**⁴²** And some of them, five hundred of the sons of Simeon, went to the hill-country of Seir, with Pelatiah and Neariah and Rephaiah and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, at their head.

**⁴³** And they put to death the rest of the Amalekites who had got away safely, and made it their living-place to this day.
