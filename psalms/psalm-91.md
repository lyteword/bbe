# Psalm 91

<sup>1</sup> Happy is he whose resting-place is in the secret of the Lord, and under the shade of the wings of the Most High; 

<sup>2</sup> Who says of the Lord, He is my safe place and my tower of strength: he is my God, in whom is my hope. 

<sup>3</sup> He will take you out of the bird-net, and keep you safe from wasting disease. 

<sup>4</sup> You will be covered by his feathers; under his wings you will be safe: his good faith will be your salvation. 

<sup>5</sup> You will have no fear of the evil things of the night, or of the arrow in flight by day, 

<sup>6</sup> Or of the disease which takes men in the dark, or of the destruction which makes waste when the sun is high. 

<sup>7</sup> You will see a thousand falling by your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it will not come near you. 

<sup>8</sup> Only with your eyes will you see the reward of the evil-doers. 

<sup>9</sup> Because you have said, I am in the hands of the Lord, the Most High is my safe resting-place; 

<sup>10</sup> No evil will come on you, and no disease will come near your tent. 

<sup>11</sup> For he will give you into the care of his angels to keep you wherever you go. 

<sup>12</sup> In their hands they will keep you up, so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone. 

<sup>13</sup> You will put your foot on the lion and the snake; the young lion and the great snake will be crushed under your feet. 

<sup>14</sup> Because he has given me his love, I will take him out of danger: I will put him in a place of honour, because he has kept my name in his heart. 

<sup>15</sup> When his cry comes up to me, I will give him an answer: I will be with him in trouble; I will make him free from danger and give him honour. 

<sup>16</sup> With long life will he be rewarded; and I will let him see my salvation.
