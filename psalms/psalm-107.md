# Psalm 107

<sup>1</sup> O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Let those whose cause the Lord has taken up say so, his people whom he has taken out of the hands of their haters; 

<sup>3</sup> Making them come together out of all the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. 

<sup>4</sup> They were wandering in the waste places; they saw no way to a resting-place. 

<sup>5</sup> Their souls became feeble for need of food and drink. 

<sup>6</sup> Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles; 

<sup>7</sup> Guiding them in the right way, so that they might come into the town of their resting-place. 

<sup>8</sup> Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men! 

<sup>9</sup> He gives its desire to the unresting soul, so that it is full of good things. 

<sup>10</sup> Those who were in the dark, in the black night, in chains of sorrow and iron; 

<sup>11</sup> Because they went against the words of God, and gave no thought to the laws of the Most High: 

<sup>12</sup> So that he made their hearts weighted down with grief; they were falling, and had no helper. 

<sup>13</sup> Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles. 

<sup>14</sup> He took them out of the dark and the black night, and all their chains were broken. 

<sup>15</sup> Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men! 

<sup>16</sup> The doors of brass are broken by his arm, and the bands of iron are cut in two. 

<sup>17</sup> Foolish men, because of their sins, and because of their wrongdoing, are troubled; 

<sup>18</sup> They are disgusted by all food, and they come near to the doors of death. 

<sup>19</sup> Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles. 

<sup>20</sup> He sent his word and made them well, and kept them safe from the underworld. 

<sup>21</sup> Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men! 

<sup>22</sup> Let them make offerings of praise, giving news of his works with cries of joy. 

<sup>23</sup> Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in the great waters; 

<sup>24</sup> They see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. 

<sup>25</sup> For at his word comes up the storm-wind, lifting high the waves. 

<sup>26</sup> The sailors go up to heaven, and down into the deep; their souls are wasted because of their trouble. 

<sup>27</sup> They are turned here and there, rolling like a man who is full of wine; and all their wisdom comes to nothing. 

<sup>28</sup> Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles. 

<sup>29</sup> He makes the storm into a calm, so that the waves are at peace. 

<sup>30</sup> Then they are glad, because the sea is quiet, and he takes them to the harbour of their desire. 

<sup>31</sup> Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men! 

<sup>32</sup> Let them give glory to him in the meeting of the people, and praise among the chiefs. 

<sup>33</sup> He makes rivers into waste places, and springs of water into a dry land; 

<sup>34</sup> He makes a fertile country into a salt waste, because of the sins of those who are living there. 

<sup>35</sup> He makes a waste land into a place of water, and a dry land into water-springs. 

<sup>36</sup> And there he gives the poor a resting-place, so that they may make themselves a town; 

<sup>37</sup> And put seed in the fields and make vine-gardens, to give them fruit. 

<sup>38</sup> He gives them his blessing so that they are increased greatly, and their cattle do not become less. 

<sup>39</sup> And when they are made low, and crushed by trouble and sorrow, 

<sup>40</sup> He puts an end to the pride of kings, and sends them wandering in the waste lands where there is no way. 

<sup>41</sup> But he puts the poor man on high from his troubles, and gives him families like a flock. 

<sup>42</sup> The upright see it and are glad: the mouth of the sinner is stopped. 

<sup>43</sup> Let the wise give thought to these things, and see the mercies of the Lord.
