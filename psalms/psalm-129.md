# Psalm 129

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. Great have been my troubles from the time when I was young (let Israel now say); 

<sup>2</sup> Great have been my troubles from the time when I was young, but my troubles have not overcome me. 

<sup>3</sup> The ploughmen were ploughing on my back; long were the wounds they made. 

<sup>4</sup> The Lord is true: the cords of the evil-doers are broken in two. 

<sup>5</sup> Let all the haters of Zion be shamed and turned back. 

<sup>6</sup> Let them be like the grass on the house-tops, which is dry before it comes to full growth. 

<sup>7</sup> He who gets in the grain has no use for it; and they do not make bands of it for the grain-stems. 

<sup>8</sup> And those who go by do not say, The blessing of the Lord be on you; we give you blessing in the name of the Lord.
