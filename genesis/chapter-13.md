# Genesis 13 

**¹** And Abram went up out of Egypt with his wife and all he had, and Lot with him, and they came in to the South.

**²** Now Abram had great wealth of cattle and silver and gold.

**³** And travelling on from the South, he came to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been before, between Beth-el and Ai;

**⁴** To the place where he had made his first altar, and there Abram gave worship to the name of the Lord.

**⁵** And Lot, who went with him, had flocks and herds and tents;

**⁶** So that the land was not wide enough for the two of them: their property was so great that there was not room for them together.

**⁷** And there was an argument between the keepers of Abram's cattle and the keepers of Lot's cattle: at that time the Canaanites and Perizzites were still living in the land.

**⁸** Then Abram said to Lot, Let there be no argument between me and you, and between my herdmen and your herdmen, for we are brothers.

**⁹** Is not all the land before you? then let us go our separate ways: if you go to the left, I will go to the right; or if you take the right, I will go to the left.

**¹⁰** And Lot, lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of Jordan, saw that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord had sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah; it was like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, on the way to Zoar.

**¹¹** So Lot took for himself all the valley of Jordan, and went to the east, and they were parted from one another.

**¹²** Abram went on living in the land of Canaan, and Lot went to the lowland towns, moving his tent as far as Sodom.

**¹³** Now the men of Sodom were evil, and great sinners before the Lord.

**¹⁴** And the Lord had said to Abram, after Lot was parted from him, From this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west:

**¹⁵** For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your seed for ever.

**¹⁶** And I will make your children like the dust of the earth, so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered, then will your children be numbered.

**¹⁷** Come, go through all the land from one end to the other for I will give it to you.

**¹⁸** And Abram, moving his tent, came and made his living-place by the holy tree of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and made an altar there to the Lord.
