# Psalm 76

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker; put to Neginoth. A Psalm. Of Asaph. A Song. In Judah is the knowledge of God; his name is great in Israel, 

<sup>2</sup> In Salem is his tent, his resting-place in Zion. 

<sup>3</sup> There were the arrows of the bow broken, there he put an end to body-cover, sword, and fight. (Selah.) 

<sup>4</sup> You are shining and full of glory, more than the eternal mountains. 

<sup>5</sup> Gone is the wealth of the strong, their last sleep has overcome them; the men of war have become feeble. 

<sup>6</sup> At the voice of your wrath, O God of Jacob, deep sleep has overcome carriage and horse. 

<sup>7</sup> You, you are to be feared; who may keep his place before you in the time of your wrath? 

<sup>8</sup> From heaven you gave your decision; the earth, in its fear, gave no sound, 

<sup>9</sup> When God took his place as judge, for the salvation of the poor on the earth. (Selah.) 

<sup>10</sup> The ... will give you praise; the rest of ... 

<sup>11</sup> Give to the Lord your God what is his by right; let all who are round him give offerings to him who is to be feared. 

<sup>12</sup> He puts an end to the wrath of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.
