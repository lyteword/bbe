# Psalm 52

To the chief music-maker. Maschil. Of David. When Doeg the Edomite came to Saul saying, David has come to the house of Ahimelech.

<sup>1</sup> Why do you take pride in wrongdoing, lifting yourself up against the upright man all the day?

<sup>2</sup> Purposing destruction, using deceit; your tongue is like a sharp blade.

<sup>3</sup> You have more love for evil than for good, for deceit than for works of righteousness. (Selah.)

<sup>4</sup> Destruction is in all your words, O false tongue.

<sup>5</sup> But God will put an end to you for ever; driving you out from your tent, uprooting you from the land of the living. (Selah.)

<sup>6</sup> The upright will see it with fear, and will say, laughing at you:

<sup>7</sup> See, this is the man who did not make God his strength, but had faith in his goods and his property, and made himself strong in his wealth.

<sup>8</sup> But I am like a branching olive-tree in the house of God; I have put my faith in his mercy for ever and ever.

<sup>9</sup> I will give you praise without end for what you have done; I will give honour to your name before your saints, for it is good.
