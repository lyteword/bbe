# Psalm 121

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. My eyes are lifted up to the hills: O where will my help come from? 

<sup>2</sup> Your help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. 

<sup>3</sup> May he not let your foot be moved: no need of sleep has he who keeps you. 

<sup>4</sup> See, the eyes of Israel's keeper will not be shut in sleep. 

<sup>5</sup> The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade on your right hand. 

<sup>6</sup> You will not be touched by the sun in the day, or by the moon at night. 

<sup>7</sup> The Lord will keep you safe from all evil; he will take care of your soul. 

<sup>8</sup> The Lord will keep watch over your going out and your coming in, from this time and for ever.
