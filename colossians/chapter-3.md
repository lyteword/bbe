# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> If then you have a new life with Christ, give your attention to the things of heaven, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. 

<sup>2</sup> Keep your mind on the higher things, not on the things of earth. 

<sup>3</sup> For your life on earth is done, and you have a secret life with Christ in God. 

<sup>4</sup> At the coming of Christ who is our life, you will be seen with him in glory. 

<sup>5</sup> Then put to death your bodies which are of the earth; wrong use of the flesh, unclean things, passion, evil desires and envy, which is the worship of strange gods; 

<sup>6</sup> Because of which the wrath of God comes on those who go against his orders; 

<sup>7</sup> Among whom you were living in the past, when you did such things. 

<sup>8</sup> But now it is right for you to put away all these things; wrath, passion, bad feeling, curses, unclean talk; 

<sup>9</sup> Do not make false statements to one another; because you have put away the old man with all his doings, 

<sup>10</sup> And have put on the new man, which has become new in knowledge after the image of his maker; 

<sup>11</sup> Where there is no Greek or Jew, no one with circumcision or without circumcision, no division between nations, no servant or free man: but Christ is all and in all. 

<sup>12</sup> As saints of God, then, holy and dearly loved, let your behaviour be marked by pity and mercy, kind feeling, a low opinion of yourselves, gentle ways, and a power of undergoing all things; 

<sup>13</sup> Being gentle to one another and having forgiveness for one another, if anyone has done wrong to his brother, even as the Lord had forgiveness for you: 

<sup>14</sup> And more than all, have love; the only way in which you may be completely joined together. 

<sup>15</sup> And let the peace of Christ be ruling in your hearts, as it was the purpose of God for you to be one body; and give praise to God at all times. 

<sup>16</sup> Let the word of Christ be in you in all wealth of wisdom; teaching and helping one another with songs of praise and holy words, making melody to God with grace in your hearts. 

<sup>17</sup> And whatever you do, in word or in act, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving praise to God the Father through him. 

<sup>18</sup> Wives, be under the authority of your husbands, as is right in the Lord. 

<sup>19</sup> Husbands, have love for your wives, and be not bitter against them. 

<sup>20</sup> Children, do the orders of your fathers and mothers in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord. 

<sup>21</sup> Fathers, do not be hard on your children, so that their spirit may not be broken. 

<sup>22</sup> Servants, in all things do the orders of your natural masters; not only when their eyes are on you, as pleasers of men, but with all your heart, fearing the Lord: 

<sup>23</sup> Whatever you do, do it readily, as to the Lord and not to men; 

<sup>24</sup> Being certain that the Lord will give you the reward of the heritage: for you are the servants of the Lord Christ. 

<sup>25</sup> For the wrongdoer will have punishment for the wrong he has done, without respect for any man's position.
