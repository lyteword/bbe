# Proverbs 21 

**¹** The king's heart in the hands of the Lord is like the water streams, and by him it is turned in any direction at his pleasure.

**²** Every way of a man seems right to himself, but the Lord is the tester of hearts.

**³** To do what is right and true is more pleasing to the Lord than an offering.

**⁴** A high look and a heart of pride, ***of the evil-doer is sin.

**⁵** The purposes of the man of industry have their outcome only in wealth; but one who is over-quick in acting will only come to be in need.

**⁶** He who gets stores of wealth by a false tongue, is going after what is only breath, and searching for death.

**⁷** By their violent acts the evil-doers will be pulled away, because they have no desire to do what is right.

**⁸** Twisted is the way of him who is full of crime; but as for him whose heart is clean, his work is upright.

**⁹** It is better to be living in an angle of the house-top, than with a bitter-tongued woman in a wide house.

**¹⁰** The desire of the evil-doer is fixed on evil: he has no kind feeling for his neighbour.

**¹¹** When the man of pride undergoes punishment, the simple man gets wisdom; and by watching the wise he gets knowledge.

**¹²** The Upright One, looking on the house of the evil-doer, lets sinners be overturned to their destruction.

**¹³** He whose ears are stopped at the cry of the poor, will himself get no answer to his cry for help.

**¹⁴** By a secret offering wrath is turned away, and the heat of angry feelings by money in the folds of the robe.

**¹⁵** It is a joy to the good man to do right, but it is destruction to the workers of evil.

**¹⁶** The wanderer from the way of knowledge will have his resting-place among the shades.

**¹⁷** The lover of pleasure will be a poor man: the lover of wine and oil will not get wealth.

**¹⁸** The evil-doer will be given as a price for the life of the good man, and the worker of deceit in the place of the upright.

**¹⁹** It is better to be living in a waste land, than with a bitter-tongued and angry woman.

**²⁰** There is a store of great value in the house of the wise, but it is wasted by the foolish man.

**²¹** He who goes after righteousness and mercy will get life, righteousness, and honour.

**²²** A wise man goes up into the town of the strong ones, and overcomes its strength in which they put their faith.

**²³** He who keeps watch over his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.

**²⁴** The man of pride, lifted up in soul, is named high-hearted; he is acting in an outburst of pride.

**²⁵** The desire of the hater of work is death to him, for his hands will do no work.

**²⁶** All the day the sinner goes after his desire: but the upright man gives freely, keeping nothing back.

**²⁷** The offering of evil-doers is disgusting: how much more when they give it with an evil purpose!

**²⁸** A false witness will be cut off, ...

**²⁹** The evil-doer makes his face hard, but as for the upright, he gives thought to his way.

**³⁰** Wisdom and knowledge and wise suggestions are of no use against the Lord.

**³¹** The horse is made ready for the day of war, but power to overcome is from the Lord.
