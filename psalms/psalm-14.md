# Psalm 14

To the chief music-maker. Of David.

**¹** The foolish man has said in his heart, God will not do anything. They are unclean, they have done evil works; there is not one who does good.

**²** The Lord was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God.

**³** They have all gone out of the way together; they are unclean, there is not one who does good, no, not one.

**⁴** Have all the workers of evil no knowledge? they take my people for food as they would take bread; they make no prayer to the Lord.

**⁵** Then were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the upright.

**⁶** You have put to shame the thoughts of the poor, but the Lord is his support.

**⁷** May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! when the fate of his people is changed by the Lord, Jacob will have joy and Israel will be glad.
