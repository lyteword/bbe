# Isaiah 53 

**¹** Who would have had faith in the word which has come to our ears, and to whom had the arm of the Lord been unveiled?

**²** For his growth was like that of a delicate plant before him, and like a root out of a dry place: he had no grace of form, to give us pleasure;

**³** Men made sport of him, turning away from him; he was a man of sorrows, marked by disease; and like one from whom men's faces are turned away, he was looked down on, and we put no value on him.

**⁴** But it was our pain he took, and our diseases were put on him: while to us he seemed as one diseased, on whom God's punishment had come.

**⁵** But it was for our sins he was wounded, and for our evil doings he was crushed: he took the punishment by which we have peace, and by his wounds we are made well.

**⁶** We all went wandering like sheep; going every one of us after his desire; and the Lord put on him the punishment of us all.

**⁷** Men were cruel to him, but he was gentle and quiet; as a lamb taken to its death, and as a sheep before those who take her wool makes no sound, so he said not a word.

**⁸** They took away from him help and right, and who gave a thought to his fate? for he was cut off from the land of the living: he came to his death for the sin of my people.

**⁹** And they put his body into the earth with sinners, and his last resting-place was with the evil-doers, though he had done no wrong, and no deceit was in his mouth.

**¹⁰** And the Lord was pleased ... see a seed, long life, ... will do well in his hand. ...

**¹¹** ... made clear his righteousness before men ... had taken their sins on himself.

**¹²** For this cause he will have a heritage with the great, and he will have a part in the goods of war with the strong, because he gave up his life, and was numbered with the evil-doers; taking on himself the sins of the people, and making prayer for the wrongdoers.
