# Psalm 17

A Prayer. Of David.

<sup>1</sup> Let my cause come to your ears, O Lord, give attention to my cry; give ear to my prayer which goes not out from false lips.

<sup>2</sup> Be my judge; for your eyes see what is right.

<sup>3</sup> You have put my heart to the test, searching me in the night; you have put me to the test and seen no evil purpose in me; I will keep my mouth from sin.

<sup>4</sup> As for the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.

<sup>5</sup> I have kept my feet in your ways, my steps have not been turned away.

<sup>6</sup> My cry has gone up to you, for you will give me an answer, O God: let your ear be turned to me, and give attention to my words.

<sup>7</sup> Make clear the wonder of your mercy, O saviour of those who put their faith in your right hand, from those who come out against them.

<sup>8</sup> Keep me as the light of your eyes, covering me with the shade of your wings,

<sup>9</sup> From the evil-doers who are violent to me, and from those who are round me, desiring my death.

<sup>10</sup> They are shut up in their fat: with their mouths they say words of pride.

<sup>11</sup> They have made a circle round our steps: their eyes are fixed on us, forcing us down to the earth;

<sup>12</sup> Like a lion desiring its food, and like a young lion waiting in secret places.

<sup>13</sup> Up! Lord, come out against him, make him low, with your sword be my saviour from the evil-doer.

<sup>14</sup> With your hand, O Lord, from men, even men of the world, whose heritage is in this life, and whom you make full with your secret wealth: they are full of children; after their death their offspring take the rest of their goods.

<sup>15</sup> As for me, I will see your face in righteousness: when I am awake it will be joy enough for me to see your form.
