# Psalm 41 

To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.

**¹** Happy is the man who gives thought to the poor; the Lord will be his saviour in the time of trouble.

**²** The Lord will keep him safe, and give him life; the Lord will let him be a blessing on the earth, and will not give him into the hand of his haters.

**³** The Lord will be his support on his bed of pain: by you will all his grief be turned to strength.

**⁴** I said, Lord, have mercy on me; make my soul well, because my faith is in you.

**⁵** My haters say evil against me, When will he be dead, and his name come to an end?

**⁶** If one comes to see me, deceit is in his heart; he keeps a store of evil, which he makes public in every place.

**⁷** All my haters are talking secretly together against me; they are designing my downfall.

**⁸** They say, He has an evil disease, which will not let him go: and now that he is down he will not get up again.

**⁹** Even my dearest friend, in whom I had faith, who took bread with me, is turned against me.

**¹⁰** But you, O Lord, have mercy on me, lifting me up, so that I may give them their punishment.

**¹¹** By this I see that you have pleasure in me, because my hater does not overcome me.

**¹²** And as for me, you are my support in my righteousness, giving me a place before your face for ever.

**¹³** May the Lord God of Israel be praised, through eternal days and for ever. So be it. So be it.
