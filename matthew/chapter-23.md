# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> Then Jesus said to the people and to his disciples: 

<sup>2</sup> The scribes and the Pharisees have the authority of Moses; 

<sup>3</sup> All things, then, which they give you orders to do, these do and keep: but do not take their works as your example, for they say and do not. 

<sup>4</sup> They make hard laws and put great weights on men's backs; but they themselves will not put a finger to them. 

<sup>5</sup> But all their works they do so as to be seen by men: for they make wide their phylacteries, and the edges of their robes, 

<sup>6</sup> And the things desired by them are the first places at feasts, and the chief seats in the Synagogues, 

<sup>7</sup> And words of respect in the market-places, and to be named by men, Teacher. 

<sup>8</sup> But you may not be named Teacher: for one is your teacher, and you are all brothers. 

<sup>9</sup> And give no man the name of father on earth: because one is your Father, who is in heaven. 

<sup>10</sup> And you may not be named guides: because one is your Guide, even Christ. 

<sup>11</sup> But let the greatest among you be your servant. 

<sup>12</sup> And whoever makes himself high will be made low, and whoever makes himself low will be made high. 

<sup>13</sup> But a curse is on you, scribes and Pharisees, false ones! because you are shutting the kingdom of heaven against men: for you do not go in yourselves, and those who are going in, you keep back.
