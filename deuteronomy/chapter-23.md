# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> No man whose private parts have been wounded or cut off may come into the meeting of the Lord's people. 

<sup>2</sup> One whose father and mother are not married may not come into the meeting of the Lord's people, or any of his family to the tenth generation. 

<sup>3</sup> No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their people to the tenth generation may come into the meeting of the Lord's people: 

<sup>4</sup> Because they gave you no bread or water on your way, when you came out of Egypt: and they got Balaam, the son of Peor, from Pethor in Aram-naharaim to put curses on you. 

<sup>5</sup> But the Lord your God would not give ear to Balaam, but let the curse be changed into a blessing to you, because of his love for you. 

<sup>6</sup> Do nothing for their peace or well-being for ever. 

<sup>7</sup> But have no hate for an Edomite, because he is your brother, or for an Egyptian, for you were living in his land. 

<sup>8</sup> Their children in the third generation may come into the meeting of the Lord's people. 

<sup>9</sup> When you go out to war and put your tents in position, keep from every evil thing. 

<sup>10</sup> If any man among you becomes unclean through anything which has taken place in the night, he is to go out from the tent-circle and keep outside it: 

<sup>11</sup> But when evening comes near, let him take a bath: and after sundown he may come back to the tents. 

<sup>12</sup> Let there be a place outside the tent-circle to which you may go; 

<sup>13</sup> And have among your arms a spade; and when you have been to that place, let that which comes from you be covered up with earth: 

<sup>14</sup> For the Lord your God is walking among your tents, to keep you safe and to give up into your hands those who are fighting against you; then let your tents be holy, so that he may see no unclean thing among you, and be turned away from you. 

<sup>15</sup> Do not give back to his master a servant who has gone in flight from his master and come to you: 

<sup>16</sup> Let him go on living among you in whatever place is most pleasing to him: do not be hard on him. 

<sup>17</sup> No daughter of Israel is to let herself be used as a loose woman for a strange god, and no son of Israel is to give himself to a man. 

<sup>18</sup> Do not take into the house of the Lord your God, as an offering for an oath, the price of a loose woman or the money given to one used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods: for these two things are disgusting to the Lord your God. 

<sup>19</sup> Do not take interest from an Israelite on anything, money or food or any other goods, which you let him have: 

<sup>20</sup> From men of other nations you may take interest, but not from an Israelite: so that the blessing of the Lord your God may be on everything to which you put your hand, in the land which you are about to take as your heritage. 

<sup>21</sup> When you take an oath to the Lord, do not be slow to give effect to it: for without doubt the Lord your God will make you responsible, and will put it to your account as sin. 

<sup>22</sup> But if you take no oath, there will be no sin. 

<sup>23</sup> Whatever your lips have said, see that you do it; for you gave your word freely to the Lord your God. 

<sup>24</sup> When you go into your neighbour's vine-garden, you may take of his grapes at your pleasure, but you may not take them away in your vessel. 

<sup>25</sup> When you go into your neighbour's field, you may take the heads of grain with your hand; but you may not put your blade to his grain.
