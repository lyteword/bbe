# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Do not make a noise about tomorrow, for you are not certain what a day's outcome may be. 

<sup>2</sup> Let another man give you praise, and not your mouth; one who is strange to you, and not your lips. 

<sup>3</sup> A stone has great weight, and sand is crushing; but the wrath of the foolish is of greater weight than these. 

<sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel, and angry feeling an overflowing stream; but who does not give way before envy? 

<sup>5</sup> Better is open protest than love kept secret. 

<sup>6</sup> The wounds of a friend are given in good faith, but the kisses of a hater are false. 

<sup>7</sup> The full man has no use for honey, but to the man in need of food every bitter thing is sweet. 

<sup>8</sup> Like a bird wandering from the place of her eggs is a man wandering from his station. 

<sup>9</sup> Oil and perfume make glad the heart, and the wise suggestion of a friend is sweet to the soul. 

<sup>10</sup> Do not give up your friend and your father's friend; and do not go into your brother's house in the day of your trouble: better is a neighbour who is near than a brother far off. 

<sup>11</sup> My son, be wise and make my heart glad, so that I may give back an answer to him who puts me to shame. 

<sup>12</sup> The sharp man sees the evil and takes cover: the simple go straight on and get into trouble. 

<sup>13</sup> Take a man's clothing if he makes himself responsible for a strange man, and get an undertaking from him who gives his word for strange men. 

<sup>14</sup> He who gives a blessing to his friend with a loud voice, getting up early in the morning, will have it put to his account as a curse. 

<sup>15</sup> Like an unending dropping on a day of rain is a bitter-tongued woman. 

<sup>16</sup> He who keeps secret the secret of his friend, will get himself a name for good faith. 

<sup>17</sup> Iron makes iron sharp; so a man makes sharp his friend. 

<sup>18</sup> Whoever keeps a fig-tree will have its fruit; and the servant waiting on his master will be honoured. 

<sup>19</sup> Like face looking at face in water, so are the hearts of men to one another. 

<sup>20</sup> The underworld and Abaddon are never full, and the eyes of man have never enough. 

<sup>21</sup> The heating-pot is for silver and the oven-fire for gold, and a man is measured by what he is praised for. 

<sup>22</sup> Even if a foolish man is crushed with a hammer in a vessel among crushed grain, still his foolish ways will not go from him. 

<sup>23</sup> Take care to have knowledge about the condition of your flocks, looking well after your herds; 

<sup>24</sup> For wealth is not for ever, and money does not go on for all generations. 

<sup>25</sup> The grass comes up and the young grass is seen, and the mountain plants are got in. 

<sup>26</sup> The lambs are for your clothing, and the he-goats make the value of a field: 

<sup>27</sup> There will be goats' milk enough for your food, and for the support of your servant-girls.
