# Psalm 121 

A Song of the going up.

**¹** My eyes are lifted up to the hills: O where will my help come from?

**²** Your help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

**³** May he not let your foot be moved: no need of sleep has he who keeps you.

**⁴** See, the eyes of Israel's keeper will not be shut in sleep.

**⁵** The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade on your right hand.

**⁶** You will not be touched by the sun in the day, or by the moon at night.

**⁷** The Lord will keep you safe from all evil; he will take care of your soul.

**⁸** The Lord will keep watch over your going out and your coming in, from this time and for ever.
