# Psalm 2

<sup>1</sup> Why are the nations so violently moved, and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish? 

<sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth have taken their place, and the rulers are fixed in their purpose, against the Lord, and against the king of his selection, saying, 

<sup>3</sup> Let their chains be broken, and their cords taken from off us. 

<sup>4</sup> Then he whose seat is in the heavens will be laughing: the Lord will make sport of them. 

<sup>5</sup> Then will his angry words come to their ears, and by his wrath they will be troubled: 

<sup>6</sup> But I have put my king on my holy hill of Zion. 

<sup>7</sup> I will make clear the Lord's decision: he has said to me, You are my son, this day have I given you being. 

<sup>8</sup> Make your request to me, and I will give you the nations for your heritage, and the farthest limits of the earth will be under your hand. 

<sup>9</sup> They will be ruled by you with a rod of iron; they will be broken like a potter's vessel. 

<sup>10</sup> So now be wise, you kings: take his teaching, you judges of the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> Give worship to the Lord with fear, kissing his feet and giving him honour, 

<sup>12</sup> For fear that he may be angry, causing destruction to come on you, because he is quickly moved to wrath. Happy are all those who put their faith in him.
