# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> He who keeps himself separate for his private purpose goes against all good sense. 

<sup>2</sup> A foolish man has no pleasure in good sense, but only to let what is in his heart come to light. 

<sup>3</sup> When the evil-doer comes, a low opinion comes with him, and with the loss of honour comes shame. 

<sup>4</sup> The words of a man's mouth are like deep waters: the fountain of wisdom is like a flowing stream. 

<sup>5</sup> To have respect for the person of the evil-doer is not good, or to give a wrong decision against the upright. 

<sup>6</sup> A foolish man's lips are a cause of fighting, and his mouth makes him open to blows. 

<sup>7</sup> The mouth of a foolish man is his destruction, and his lips are a net for his soul. 

<sup>8</sup> The words of one who says evil of his neighbour secretly are like sweet food, and go down into the inner parts of the stomach. 

<sup>9</sup> He who does not give his mind to his work is brother to him who makes destruction. 

<sup>10</sup> The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the upright man running into it is safe. 

<sup>11</sup> The property of a man of wealth is his strong town, and it is as a high wall in the thoughts of his heart. 

<sup>12</sup> Before destruction the heart of man is full of pride, and before honour goes a gentle spirit. 

<sup>13</sup> To give an answer before hearing is a foolish thing and a cause of shame. 

<sup>14</sup> The spirit of a man will be his support when he is ill; but how may a broken spirit be lifted up? 

<sup>15</sup> The heart of the man of good sense gets knowledge; the ear of the wise is searching for knowledge. 

<sup>16</sup> A man's offering makes room for him, letting him come before great men. 

<sup>17</sup> The man who first puts his cause before the judge seems to be in the right; but then his neighbour comes and puts his cause in its true light. 

<sup>18</sup> The decision of chance puts an end to argument, parting the strong. 

<sup>19</sup> A brother wounded is like a strong town, and violent acts are like a locked tower. 

<sup>20</sup> With the fruit of a man's mouth his stomach will be full; the produce of his lips will be his in full measure. 

<sup>21</sup> Death and life are in the power of the tongue; and those to whom it is dear will have its fruit for their food. 

<sup>22</sup> Whoever gets a wife gets a good thing, and has the approval of the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> The poor man makes requests for grace, but the man of wealth gives a rough answer. 

<sup>24</sup> There are friends who may be a man's destruction, but there is a lover who keeps nearer than a brother.
