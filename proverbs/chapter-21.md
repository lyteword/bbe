# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> The king's heart in the hands of the Lord is like the water streams, and by him it is turned in any direction at his pleasure. 

<sup>2</sup> Every way of a man seems right to himself, but the Lord is the tester of hearts. 

<sup>3</sup> To do what is right and true is more pleasing to the Lord than an offering. 

<sup>4</sup> A high look and a heart of pride, ***of the evil-doer is sin. 

<sup>5</sup> The purposes of the man of industry have their outcome only in wealth; but one who is over-quick in acting will only come to be in need. 

<sup>6</sup> He who gets stores of wealth by a false tongue, is going after what is only breath, and searching for death. 

<sup>7</sup> By their violent acts the evil-doers will be pulled away, because they have no desire to do what is right. 

<sup>8</sup> Twisted is the way of him who is full of crime; but as for him whose heart is clean, his work is upright. 

<sup>9</sup> It is better to be living in an angle of the house-top, than with a bitter-tongued woman in a wide house. 

<sup>10</sup> The desire of the evil-doer is fixed on evil: he has no kind feeling for his neighbour. 

<sup>11</sup> When the man of pride undergoes punishment, the simple man gets wisdom; and by watching the wise he gets knowledge. 

<sup>12</sup> The Upright One, looking on the house of the evil-doer, lets sinners be overturned to their destruction. 

<sup>13</sup> He whose ears are stopped at the cry of the poor, will himself get no answer to his cry for help. 

<sup>14</sup> By a secret offering wrath is turned away, and the heat of angry feelings by money in the folds of the robe. 

<sup>15</sup> It is a joy to the good man to do right, but it is destruction to the workers of evil. 

<sup>16</sup> The wanderer from the way of knowledge will have his resting-place among the shades. 

<sup>17</sup> The lover of pleasure will be a poor man: the lover of wine and oil will not get wealth. 

<sup>18</sup> The evil-doer will be given as a price for the life of the good man, and the worker of deceit in the place of the upright. 

<sup>19</sup> It is better to be living in a waste land, than with a bitter-tongued and angry woman. 

<sup>20</sup> There is a store of great value in the house of the wise, but it is wasted by the foolish man. 

<sup>21</sup> He who goes after righteousness and mercy will get life, righteousness, and honour. 

<sup>22</sup> A wise man goes up into the town of the strong ones, and overcomes its strength in which they put their faith. 

<sup>23</sup> He who keeps watch over his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles. 

<sup>24</sup> The man of pride, lifted up in soul, is named high-hearted; he is acting in an outburst of pride. 

<sup>25</sup> The desire of the hater of work is death to him, for his hands will do no work. 

<sup>26</sup> All the day the sinner goes after his desire: but the upright man gives freely, keeping nothing back. 

<sup>27</sup> The offering of evil-doers is disgusting: how much more when they give it with an evil purpose! 

<sup>28</sup> A false witness will be cut off, ... 

<sup>29</sup> The evil-doer makes his face hard, but as for the upright, he gives thought to his way. 

<sup>30</sup> Wisdom and knowledge and wise suggestions are of no use against the Lord. 

<sup>31</sup> The horse is made ready for the day of war, but power to overcome is from the Lord.
