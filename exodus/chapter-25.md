# Exodus 25 

**¹** And the Lord said to Moses,

**²** Say to the children of Israel that they are to make me an offering; from every man who has the impulse in his heart take an offering for me.

**³** And this is the offering you are to take from them: gold and silver and brass;

**⁴** And blue and purple and red, and the best linen, and goats' hair;

**⁵** And sheepskins coloured red, and leather, and hard wood;

**⁶** Oil for the light, spices for the sweet-smelling oil, sweet perfumes for burning;

**⁷** Beryls and stones of value to be put on the ephod and on the priest's bag.

**⁸** And let them make me a holy place, so that I may be ever present among them.

**⁹** Make the House and everything in it from the designs which I will give you.

**¹⁰** And they are to make an ark of hard wood; two and a half cubits long, and a cubit and a half wide and high.

**¹¹** It is to be plated inside and out with the best gold, with an edge of gold all round it

**¹²** And make four rings of gold for it, to be fixed on its four feet, two rings on one side of it and two on the other.

**¹³** And make rods of the same wood, plating them with gold.

**¹⁴** And put the rods through the rings at the sides of the ark, for lifting it.

**¹⁵** The rods are to be kept in the rings, and never taken out.

**¹⁶** Inside the ark you are to put the record which I will give you.

**¹⁷** And you are to make a cover of the best gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.

**¹⁸** And at the two ends of the cover you are to make two winged ones of hammered gold,

**¹⁹** One at one end and one at the other; the winged ones are to be part of the cover.

**²⁰** And their wings are to be outstretched over the cover, and the winged ones are to be opposite one another, facing the cover.

**²¹** And put the cover over the ark, and in the ark the record which I will give you.

**²²** And there, between the two winged ones on the cover of the ark, I will come to you, face to face, and make clear to you all the orders I have to give you for the children of Israel.

**²³** And you are to make a table of the same wood, two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high,

**²⁴** Plated with the best gold, with a gold edge all round it;

**²⁵** And make a frame all round it, as wide as a man's hand, with a gold edge to the frame.

**²⁶** And make four gold rings and put them at the four angles, on the four feet of the table;

**²⁷** The rings are to be fixed under the frame to take the rods with which the table is to be lifted.

**²⁸** Make rods of the same wood, plated with gold, for lifting the table.

**²⁹** And make the table-vessels, the spoons and the cups and the basins for liquids, all of the best gold.

**³⁰** And on the table at all times you are to keep my holy bread.

**³¹** And you are to make a support for lights, of the best gold; its base and its pillar are to be of hammered gold; its cups, its buds, and its flowers are to be made of the same metal.

**³²** It is to have six branches coming out from its sides; three branches from one side and three from the other.

**³³** Every branch having three cups made like almond flowers, every cup with a bud and a flower, on all the branches.

**³⁴** And on the pillar, four cups like almond flowers, every one with its bud and its flower:

**³⁵** And under every two branches a bud, made with the branch, for all the six branches of it.

**³⁶** The buds and the branches are to be made of the same metal; all together one complete work of hammered gold.

**³⁷** Then you are to make its seven vessels for the lights, putting them in their place so that they give light in front of it.

**³⁸** And the instruments and trays for use with it are all to be of the best gold.

**³⁹** A talent of gold will be needed for it, with all these vessels.

**⁴⁰** And see that you make them from the design which you saw on the mountain.
