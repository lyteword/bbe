# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> I have said these things to you so that you may not be in doubt. 

<sup>2</sup> They will put you out of the Synagogues: yes, the time is coming when whoever puts you to death will have the belief that he is doing God's pleasure. 

<sup>3</sup> They will do these things to you because they have not had knowledge of the Father or of me. 

<sup>4</sup> I have said these things to you so that when the time comes, what I have said may come to your mind. I did not say them to you at the first, because then I was still with you. 

<sup>5</sup> But now I am going to him who sent me; and not one of you says to me, Where are you going? 

<sup>6</sup> But your hearts are full of sorrow because I have said these things. 

<sup>7</sup> But what I am saying is true: my going is for your good: for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 

<sup>8</sup> And he, when he comes, will make the world conscious of sin, and of righteousness, and of being judged: 

<sup>9</sup> Of sin, because they have not faith in me; 

<sup>10</sup> Of righteousness, because I go to the Father and you will see me no more; 

<sup>11</sup> Of being judged, because the ruler of this world has been judged. 

<sup>12</sup> I have still much to say to you, but you are not strong enough for it now. 

<sup>13</sup> However, when he, the Spirit of true knowledge, has come, he will be your guide into all true knowledge: for his words will not come from himself, but whatever has come to his hearing, that he will say: and he will make clear to you the things to come. 

<sup>14</sup> He will give me glory, because he will take of what is mine, and make it clear to you. 

<sup>15</sup> Everything which the Father has is mine: that is why I say, He will take of what is mine and will make it clear to you. 

<sup>16</sup> After a little time you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me. 

<sup>17</sup> So some of the disciples said one to another, What is this he is saying, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me? and, I am going to the Father? 

<sup>18</sup> So they said again and again, What is this he is saying, A little time? His words are not clear to us. 

<sup>19</sup> Jesus saw that they had a desire to put the question to him, so he said to them, Is this what you are questioning one with another, why I said, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me? 

<sup>20</sup> Truly I say to you, You will be weeping and sorrowing, but the world will be glad: you will be sad, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. 

<sup>21</sup> When a woman is about to give birth she has sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she has given birth to the child, the pain is put out of her mind by the joy that a man has come into the world. 

<sup>22</sup> So you have sorrow now: but I will see you again, and your hearts will be glad, and no one will take away your joy. 

<sup>23</sup> And on that day you will put no questions to me. Truly I say to you, Whatever request you make to the Father, he will give it to you in my name. 

<sup>24</sup> Up to now you have made no request in my name: do so, and it will be answered, so that your hearts may be full of joy. 

<sup>25</sup> All this I have said to you in veiled language: but the time is coming when I will no longer say things in veiled language but will give you knowledge of the Father clearly. 

<sup>26</sup> In that day you will make requests in my name: and I do not say that I will make prayer to the Father for you, 

<sup>27</sup> For the Father himself gives his love to you, because you have given your love to me and have had faith that I came from God. 

<sup>28</sup> I came out from the Father and have come into the world: again, I go away from the world and go to the Father. 

<sup>29</sup> His disciples said, Now you are talking clearly and not in veiled language. 

<sup>30</sup> Now we are certain that you have knowledge of all things and have no need for anyone to put questions to you: through this we have faith that you came from God. 

<sup>31</sup> Jesus made answer, Have you faith now? 

<sup>32</sup> See, a time is coming, yes, it is now here, when you will go away in all directions, every man to his house, and I will be by myself: but I am not by myself, because the Father is with me. 

<sup>33</sup> I have said all these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble: but take heart! I have overcome the world.
