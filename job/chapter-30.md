# Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> But now those who are younger than I make sport of me; those whose fathers I would not have put with the dogs of my flocks. 

<sup>2</sup> Of what use is the strength of their hands to me? all force is gone from them. 

<sup>3</sup> They are wasted for need of food, biting the dry earth; their only hope of life is in the waste land. 

<sup>4</sup> They are pulling off the salt leaves from the brushwood, and making a meal of roots. 

<sup>5</sup> They are sent out from among their townsmen, men are crying after them as thieves 

<sup>6</sup> They have to get a resting-place in the hollows of the valleys, in holes of the earth and rocks. 

<sup>7</sup> They make noises like asses among the brushwood; they get together under the thorns. 

<sup>8</sup> They are sons of shame, and of men without a name, who have been forced out of the land. 

<sup>9</sup> And now I have become their song, and I am a word of shame to them. 

<sup>10</sup> I am disgusting to them; they keep away from me, and put marks of shame on me. 

<sup>11</sup> For he has made loose the cord of my bow, and put me to shame; he has sent down my flag to the earth before me. 

<sup>12</sup> The lines of his men of war put themselves in order, and make high their ways of destruction against me: 

<sup>13</sup> They have made waste my roads, with a view to my destruction; his bowmen come round about me; 

<sup>14</sup> As through a wide broken place in the wall they come on, I am overturned by the shock of their attack. 

<sup>15</sup> Fears have come on me; my hope is gone like the wind, and my well-being like a cloud. 

<sup>16</sup> But now my soul is turned to water in me, days of trouble overtake me: 

<sup>17</sup> The flesh is gone from my bones, and they give me no rest; there is no end to my pains. 

<sup>18</sup> With great force he takes a grip of my clothing, pulling me by the neck of my coat. 

<sup>19</sup> Truly God has made me low, even to the earth, and I have become like dust. 

<sup>20</sup> You give no answer to my cry, and take no note of my prayer. 

<sup>21</sup> You have become cruel to me; the strength of your hand is hard on me. 

<sup>22</sup> Lifting me up, you make me go on the wings of the wind; I am broken up by the storm. 

<sup>23</sup> For I am certain that you will send me back to death, and to the meeting-place ordered for all living. 

<sup>24</sup> Has not my hand been stretched out in help to the poor? have I not been a saviour to him in his trouble? 

<sup>25</sup> Have I not been weeping for the crushed? and was not my soul sad for him who was in need? 

<sup>26</sup> For I was looking for good, and evil came; I was waiting for light, and it became dark. 

<sup>27</sup> My feelings are strongly moved, and give me no rest; days of trouble have overtaken me. 

<sup>28</sup> I go about in dark clothing, uncomforted; I get up in the public place, crying out for help. 

<sup>29</sup> I have become a brother to the jackals, and go about in the company of ostriches. 

<sup>30</sup> My skin is black and dropping off me; and my bones are burning with the heat of my disease. 

<sup>31</sup> And my music has been turned to sorrow, and the sound of my pipe into the noise of weeping.
