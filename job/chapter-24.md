# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> Why are times not stored up by the Ruler of all, and why do those who have knowledge of him not see his days? 

<sup>2</sup> The landmarks are changed by evil men, they violently take away flocks, together with their keepers. 

<sup>3</sup> They send away the ass of him who has no father, they take the widow's ox for debt. 

<sup>4</sup> The crushed are turned out of the way; all the poor of the earth go into a secret place together. 

<sup>5</sup> Like asses in the waste land they go out to their work, looking for food with care; from the waste land they get bread for their children. 

<sup>6</sup> They get mixed grain from the field, and they take away the late fruit from the vines of those who have wealth. 

<sup>7</sup> They take their rest at night without clothing, and have no cover in the cold. 

<sup>8</sup> They are wet with the rain of the mountains, and get into the cracks of the rock for cover. 

<sup>9</sup> The child without a father is forced from its mother's breast, and they take the young children of the poor for debt. 

<sup>10</sup> Others go about without clothing, and though they have no food, they get in the grain from the fields. 

<sup>11</sup> Between the lines of olive-trees they make oil; though they have no drink, they are crushing out the grapes. 

<sup>12</sup> From the town come sounds of pain from those who are near death, and the soul of the wounded is crying out for help; but God does not take note of their prayer. 

<sup>13</sup> Then there are those who are haters of the light, who have no knowledge of its ways, and do not go in them. 

<sup>14</sup> He who is purposing death gets up before day, so that he may put to death the poor and those in need. 

<sup>15</sup> And the man whose desire is for the wife of another is waiting for the evening, saying, No eye will see me; and he puts a cover on his face. And in the night the thief goes about; 

<sup>16</sup> In the dark he makes holes in the walls of houses: in the daytime they are shutting themselves up, they have no knowledge of the light. 

<sup>17</sup> For the middle of the night is as morning to them, they are not troubled by the fear of the dark. 

<sup>18</sup> They go quickly on the face of the waters; their heritage is cursed in the earth; the steps of the crusher of grapes are not turned to their vine-garden. 

<sup>19</sup> Snow waters become dry with the heat: so do sinners go down into the underworld. 

<sup>20</sup> The public place of his town has no more knowledge of him, and his name has gone from the memory of men: he is rooted up like a dead tree. 

<sup>21</sup> He is not kind to the widow, and he has no pity for her child. 

<sup>22</sup> But God by his power gives long life to the strong; he gets up again, though he has no hope of life. 

<sup>23</sup> He takes away his fear of danger and gives him support; and his eyes are on his ways. 

<sup>24</sup> For a short time they are lifted up; then they are gone; they are made low, they are pulled off like fruit, and like the heads of grain they are cut off. 

<sup>25</sup> And if it is not so, now, who will make it clear that my words are false, and that what I say is of no value?
