# Job 23 

**¹** And Job made answer and said,

**²** Even today my outcry is bitter; his hand is hard on my sorrow.

**³** If only I had knowledge of where he might be seen, so that I might come even to his seat!

**⁴** I would put my cause in order before him, and my mouth would be full of arguments.

**⁵** I would see what his answers would be, and have knowledge of what he would say to me.

**⁶** Would he make use of his great power to overcome me? No, but he would give attention to me.

**⁷** There an upright man might put his cause before him; and I would be free for ever from my judge.

**⁸** See, I go forward, but he is not there; and back, but I do not see him;

**⁹** I am looking for him on the left hand, but there is no sign of him; and turning to the right, I am not able to see him.

**¹⁰** For he has knowledge of the way I take; after I have been tested I will come out like gold.

**¹¹** My feet have gone in his steps; I have kept in his way, without turning to one side or to the other.

**¹²** I have never gone against the orders of his lips; the words of his mouth have been stored up in my heart.

**¹³** But his purpose is fixed and there is no changing it; and he gives effect to the desire of his soul.

**¹⁴** For what has been ordered for me by him will be gone through to the end: and his mind is full of such designs.

**¹⁵** For this cause I am in fear before him, my thoughts of him overcome me.

**¹⁶** For God has made my heart feeble, and my mind is troubled before the Ruler of all.

**¹⁷** For I am overcome by the dark, and by the black night which is covering my face.
