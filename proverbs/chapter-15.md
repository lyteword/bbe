# Proverbs 15 

**¹** By a soft answer wrath is turned away, but a bitter word is a cause of angry feelings.

**²** Knowledge is dropping from the tongue of the wise; but from the mouth of the foolish comes a stream of foolish words.

**³** The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good.

**⁴** A comforting tongue is a tree of life, but a twisted tongue is a crushing of the spirit.

**⁵** A foolish man puts no value on his father's training; but he who has respect for teaching has good sense.

**⁶** In the house of the upright man there is a great store of wealth; but in the profits of the sinner there is trouble.

**⁷** The lips of the wise keep knowledge, but the heart of the foolish man is not right.

**⁸** The offering of the evil-doer is disgusting to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright man is his delight.

**⁹** The way of the evil-doer is disgusting to the Lord, but he who goes after righteousness is dear to him.

**¹⁰** There is bitter punishment for him who is turned from the way; and death will be the fate of the hater of teaching.

**¹¹** Before the Lord are the underworld and destruction: how much more, then, the hearts of the children of men!

**¹²** The hater of authority has no love for teaching: he will not go to the wise.

**¹³** A glad heart makes a shining face, but by the sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.

**¹⁴** The heart of the man of good sense goes in search of knowledge, but foolish things are the food of the unwise.

**¹⁵** All the days of the troubled are evil; but he whose heart is glad has an unending feast.

**¹⁶** Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great wealth together with trouble.

**¹⁷** Better is a simple meal where love is, than a fat ox and hate with it.

**¹⁸** An angry man makes men come to blows, but he who is slow to get angry puts an end to fighting.

**¹⁹** Thorns are round the way of the hater of work; but the road of the hard worker becomes a highway.

**²⁰** A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish man has no respect for his mother.

**²¹** Foolish behaviour is joy to the unwise; but a man of good sense makes his way straight.

**²²** Where there are no wise suggestions, purposes come to nothing; but by a number of wise guides they are made certain.

**²³** A man has joy in the answer of his mouth: and a word at the right time, how good it is!

**²⁴** Acting wisely is the way of life, guiding a man away from the underworld.

**²⁵** The house of the man of pride will be uprooted by the Lord, but he will make safe the heritage of the widow.

**²⁶** Evil designs are disgusting to the Lord, but the words of the clean-hearted are pleasing.

**²⁷** He whose desires are fixed on profit is a cause of trouble to his family; but he who has no desire for offerings will have life.

**²⁸** The heart of the upright gives thought to his answer; but from the mouth of the evil-doer comes a stream of evil things.

**²⁹** The Lord is far from sinners, but his ear is open to the prayer of the upright.

**³⁰** The light of the eyes is a joy to the heart, and good news makes the bones fat.

**³¹** The man whose ear is open to the teaching of life will have his place among the wise.

**³²** He who will not be controlled by training has no respect for his soul, but he who gives ear to teaching will get wisdom.

**³³** The fear of the Lord is the teaching of wisdom; and a low opinion of oneself goes before honour.
