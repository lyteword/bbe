# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Give ear, my sons, to the teaching of a father; give attention so that you may have knowledge: 

<sup>2</sup> For I give you good teaching; do not give up the knowledge you are getting from me. 

<sup>3</sup> For I was a son to my father, a gentle and an only one to my mother. 

<sup>4</sup> And he gave me teaching, saying to me, Keep my words in your heart; keep my rules so that you may have life: 

<sup>5</sup> Get wisdom, get true knowledge; keep it in memory, do not be turned away from the words of my mouth. 

<sup>6</sup> Do not give her up, and she will keep you; give her your love, and she will make you safe. 

<sup>7</sup> The first sign of wisdom is to get wisdom; go, give all you have to get true knowledge. 

<sup>8</sup> Put her in a high place, and you will be lifted up by her; she will give you honour, when you give her your love. 

<sup>9</sup> She will put a crown of grace on your head, giving you a head-dress of glory. 

<sup>10</sup> Give ear, O my son, and let your heart be open to my sayings; and long life will be yours. 

<sup>11</sup> I have given you teaching in the way of wisdom, guiding your steps in the straight way. 

<sup>12</sup> When you go, your way will not be narrow, and in running you will not have a fall. 

<sup>13</sup> Take learning in your hands, do not let her go: keep her, for she is your life. 

<sup>14</sup> Do not go in the road of sinners, or be walking in the way of evil men. 

<sup>15</sup> Keep far from it, do not go near; be turned from it, and go on your way. 

<sup>16</sup> For they take no rest till they have done evil; their sleep is taken away if they have not been the cause of someone's fall. 

<sup>17</sup> The bread of evil-doing is their food, the wine of violent acts their drink. 

<sup>18</sup> But the way of the upright is like the light of early morning, getting brighter and brighter till the full day. 

<sup>19</sup> The way of sinners is dark; they see not the cause of their fall. 

<sup>20</sup> My son, give attention to my words; let your ear be turned to my sayings. 

<sup>21</sup> Let them not go from your eyes; keep them deep in your heart. 

<sup>22</sup> For they are life to him who gets them, and strength to all his flesh. 

<sup>23</sup> And keep watch over your heart with all care; so you will have life. 

<sup>24</sup> Put away from you an evil tongue, and let false lips be far from you. 

<sup>25</sup> Keep your eyes on what is in front of you, looking straight before you. 

<sup>26</sup> Keep a watch on your behaviour; let all your ways be rightly ordered. 

<sup>27</sup> Let there be no turning to the right or to the left, keep your feet from evil.
