# Job 39 

**¹** Have you knowledge of the rock-goats? or do you see the roes giving birth to their young?

**²** Is the number of their months fixed by you? or is the time when they give birth ordered by you?

**³** They are bent down, they give birth to their young, they let loose the fruit of their body.

**⁴** Their young ones are strong, living in the open country; they go out and do not come back again.

**⁵** Who has let the ass of the fields go free? or made loose the bands of the loud-voiced beast?

**⁶** To whom I have given the waste land for a heritage, and the salt land as a living-place.

**⁷** He makes sport of the noise of the town; the voice of the driver does not come to his ears;

**⁸** He goes looking for his grass-lands in the mountains, searching out every green thing.

**⁹** Will the ox of the mountains be your servant? or is his night's resting-place by your food-store?

**¹⁰** Will he be pulling your plough with cords, turning up the valleys after you?

**¹¹** Will you put your faith in him, because his strength is great? will you give the fruit of your work into his care?

**¹²** Will you be looking for him to come back, and get in your seed to the crushing-floor?

**¹³** Is the wing of the ostrich feeble, or is it because she has no feathers,

**¹⁴** That she puts her eggs on the earth, warming them in the dust,

**¹⁵** Without a thought that they may be crushed by the foot, and broken by the beasts of the field?

**¹⁶** She is cruel to her young ones, as if they were not hers; her work is to no purpose; she has no fear.

**¹⁷** For God has taken wisdom from her mind, and given her no measure of knowledge.

**¹⁸** When she is shaking her wings on high, she makes sport of the horse and of him who is seated on him.

**¹⁹** Do you give strength to the horse? is it by your hand that his neck is clothed with power?

**²⁰** Is it through you that he is shaking like a locust, in the pride of his loud-sounding breath?

**²¹** He is stamping with joy in the valley; he makes sport of fear.

**²²** In his strength he goes out against the arms of war, turning not away from the sword.

**²³** The bow is sounding against him; he sees the shining point of spear and arrow.

**²⁴** Shaking with passion, he is biting the earth; he is not able to keep quiet at the sound of the horn;

**²⁵** When it comes to his ears he says, Aha! He is smelling the fight from far off, and hearing the thunder of the captains, and the war-cries.

**²⁶** Is it through your knowledge that the hawk takes his flight, stretching out his wings to the south?

**²⁷** Or is it by your orders that the eagle goes up, and makes his resting-place on high?

**²⁸** On the rock is his house, and on the mountain-top his strong place.

**²⁹** From there he is watching for food; his eye sees it far off.

**³⁰** His young have blood for their drink, and where the dead bodies are, there is he to be seen.
