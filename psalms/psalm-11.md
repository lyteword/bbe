# Psalm 11

For the chief music-maker. Of David.

<sup>1</sup> In the Lord put I my faith; how will you say to my soul, Go in flight like a bird to the mountain?

<sup>2</sup> See, the bows of the evil-doers are bent, they make ready their arrows on the cord, so that they may send them secretly against the upright in heart.

<sup>3</sup> If the bases are broken down, what is the upright man to do?

<sup>4</sup> The Lord is in his holy Temple, the Lord's seat is in heaven; his eyes are watching and testing the children of men.

<sup>5</sup> The Lord puts the upright and the sinner to the test, but he has hate in his soul for the lover of violent acts.

<sup>6</sup> On the evil-doer he will send down fire and flames, and a burning wind; with these will their cup be full.

<sup>7</sup> For the Lord is upright; he is a lover of righteousness: the upright will see his face.
