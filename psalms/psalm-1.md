# Psalm 1

<sup>1</sup> Happy is the man who does not go in the company of sinners, or take his place in the way of evil-doers, or in the seat of those who do not give honour to the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> But whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and whose mind is on his law day and night. 

<sup>3</sup> He will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, which gives its fruit at the right time, whose leaves will ever be green; and he will do well in all his undertakings. 

<sup>4</sup> The evil-doers are not so; but are like the dust from the grain, which the wind takes away. 

<sup>5</sup> For this cause there will be no mercy for sinners when they are judged, and the evil-doers will have no place among the upright, 

<sup>6</sup> Because the Lord sees the way of the upright, but the end of the sinner is destruction.
