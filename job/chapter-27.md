# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> And Job again took up the word and said, 

<sup>2</sup> By the life of God, who has taken away my right; and of the Ruler of all, who has made my soul bitter; 

<sup>3</sup> (For all my breath is still in me, and the spirit of God is my life;) 

<sup>4</sup> Truly, there is no deceit in my lips, and my tongue does not say what is false. 

<sup>5</sup> Let it be far from me! I will certainly not say that you are right! I will come to death before I give up my righteousness. 

<sup>6</sup> I will keep it safe, and will not let it go: my heart has nothing to say against any part of my life. 

<sup>7</sup> Let my hater be like the evil man, and let him who comes against me be as the sinner. 

<sup>8</sup> For what is the hope of the sinner when he is cut off, when God takes back his soul? 

<sup>9</sup> Will his cry come to the ears of God when he is in trouble? 

<sup>10</sup> Will he take delight in the Ruler of all, and make his prayer to God at all times? 

<sup>11</sup> I will give you teaching about the hand of God; I will not keep secret from you what is in the mind of the Ruler of all. 

<sup>12</sup> Truly, you have all seen it yourselves; why then have you become completely foolish? 

<sup>13</sup> This is the punishment of the evil-doer from God, and the heritage given to the cruel by the Ruler of all. 

<sup>14</sup> If his children are increased, it is for the sword; and his offspring have not enough bread. 

<sup>15</sup> When those of his house who are still living come to their end by disease, they are not put into the earth, and their widows are not weeping for them. 

<sup>16</sup> Though he may get silver together like dust, and make ready great stores of clothing; 

<sup>17</sup> He may get them ready, but the upright will put them on, and he who is free from sin will take the silver for a heritage. 

<sup>18</sup> His house has no more strength than a spider's thread, or a watchman's tent. 

<sup>19</sup> He goes to rest full of wealth, but does so for the last time: on opening his eyes, he sees it there no longer. 

<sup>20</sup> Fears overtake him like rushing waters; in the night the storm-wind takes him away. 

<sup>21</sup> The east wind takes him up and he is gone; he is forced violently out of his place. 

<sup>22</sup> God sends his arrows against him without mercy; he goes in flight before his hand. 

<sup>23</sup> Men make signs of joy because of him, driving him from his place with sounds of hissing.
