# Psalm 46 

To the chief music-maker. Of the sons of Korah; put to Alamoth. A Song.

**¹** God is our harbour and our strength, a very present help in trouble.

**²** For this cause we will have no fear, even though the earth is changed, and though the mountains are moved in the heart of the sea;

**³** Though its waters are sounding and troubled, and though the mountains are shaking with their violent motion. (Selah.)

**⁴** There is a river whose streams make glad the resting-place of God, the holy place of the tents of the Most High.

**⁵** God has taken his place in her; she will not be moved: he will come to her help at the dawn of morning.

**⁶** The nations were angry, the kingdoms were moved; at the sound of his voice the earth became like wax.

**⁷** The Lord of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our high tower. (Selah.)

**⁸** Come, see the works of the Lord, the destruction which he has made in the earth.

**⁹** He puts an end to wars over all the earth; by him the bow is broken, and the spear cut in two, and the carriage burned in the fire.

**¹⁰** Be at peace in the knowledge that I am God: I will be lifted up among the nations, I will be honoured through all the earth.

**¹¹** The Lord of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our high tower. (Selah.)
