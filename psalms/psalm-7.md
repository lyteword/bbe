# Psalm 7

Shiggaion of David; a song which he made to the Lord, about the words of Cush the Benjamite.

**¹** O Lord my God, I put my faith in you; take me out of the hands of him who is cruel to me, and make me free;

**²** So that he may not come rushing on my soul like a lion, wounding it, while there is no one to be my saviour.

**³** O Lord my God, if I have done this; if my hands have done any wrong;

**⁴** If I have given back evil to him who did evil to me, or have taken anything from him who was against me without cause;

**⁵** Let my hater go after my soul and take it; let my life be crushed to the earth, and my honour into the dust. (Selah.)

**⁶** Come up, Lord, in your wrath; be lifted up against my haters; be awake, my God, give orders for the judging.

**⁷** The meeting of the nations will be round you; take your seat, then, over them, on high.

**⁸** The Lord will be judge of the peoples; give a decision for me, O Lord, because of my righteousness, and let my virtue have its reward.

**⁹** O let the evil of the evil-doer come to an end, but give strength to the upright: for men's minds and hearts are tested by the God of righteousness.

**¹⁰** God, who is the saviour of the upright in heart, is my breastplate.

**¹¹** God is the judge of the upright, and is angry with the evil-doers every day.

**¹²** If a man is not turned from his evil, he will make his sword sharp; his bow is bent and ready.

**¹³** He has made ready for him the instruments of death; he makes his arrows flames of fire.

**¹⁴** That man is a worker of evil; the seed of wrongdoing has given birth to deceit.

**¹⁵** He has made a hole deep in the earth, and is falling into the hole which he has made

**¹⁶** His wrongdoing will come back to him, and his violent behaviour will come down on his head.

**¹⁷** I will give praise to the Lord for his righteousness; I will make a song to the name of the Lord Most High.
