# Habakkuk 3 

**¹** A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, put to Shigionoth.

**²** O Lord, word of you has come to my ears; I have seen your work, O Lord; when the years come near make it clear; in wrath keep mercy in mind.

**³** God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. The heavens were covered with his glory, and the earth was full of his praise.

**⁴** He was shining like the light; he had rays coming out from his hand: there his power was kept secret.

**⁵** Before him went disease, and flames went out at his feet.

**⁶** From his high place he sent shaking on the earth; he saw and nations were suddenly moved: and the eternal mountains were broken, the unchanging hills were bent down; his ways are eternal.

**⁷** The curtains of Cushan were troubled, and the tents of Midian were shaking.

**⁸** Was your wrath burning against the rivers? were you angry with the sea, that you went on your horses, on your war-carriages of salvation?

**⁹** Your bow was quite uncovered. Selah. By you the earth was cut through with rivers.

**¹⁰** The mountains saw you and were moved with fear; the clouds were streaming with water: the voice of the deep was sounding; the sun did not come up, and the moon kept still in her place.

**¹¹** At the light of your arrows they went away, at the shining of your polished spear.

**¹²** You went stepping through the land in wrath, crushing the nations in your passion.

**¹³** You went out for the salvation of your people, for the salvation of the one on whom your holy oil was put; wounding the head of the family of the evil-doer, uncovering the base even to the neck. Selah.

**¹⁴** You have put your spears through his head, his horsemen were sent in flight like dry stems; they had joy in driving away the poor, in making a meal of them secretly.

**¹⁵** The feet of your horses were on the sea, on the mass of great waters.

**¹⁶** Hearing it, my inner parts were moved, and my lips were shaking at the sound; my bones became feeble, and my steps were uncertain under me: I gave sounds of grief in the day of trouble, when his forces came up against the people in bands.

**¹⁷** For though the fig-tree has no flowers, and there is no fruit on the vine, and work on the olive comes to nothing, and the fields give no food; and the flock is cut off from its resting-place, and there is no herd in the cattle-house:

**¹⁸** Still, I will be glad in the Lord, my joy will be in the God of my salvation.

**¹⁹** The Lord God is my strength, and he makes my feet like roes' feet, guiding me on my high places. For the chief music-maker on corded instruments.
