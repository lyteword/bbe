# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Make your request to the Lord for rain in the time of the spring rains, even to the Lord who makes the thunder-flames; and he will give them showers of rain, to every man grass in the field.

<sup>2</sup> For the images have said what is not true, and the readers of signs have seen deceit; they have given accounts of false dreams, they give comfort to no purpose: so they go out of the way like sheep, they are troubled because they have no keeper.

<sup>3</sup> My wrath is burning against the keepers of the flock, and I will send punishment on the he-goats: for the Lord of armies takes care of his flock, the people of Judah, and will make them like the horse of his pride in the fight.

<sup>4</sup> From him will come the keystone, from him the nail, from him the bow of war, from him will come every ruler;

<sup>5</sup> Together they will be like men of war, crushing down their haters into the earth of the streets in the fight; they will make war because the Lord is with them: and the horsemen will be shamed.

<sup>6</sup> And I will make the children of Judah strong, and I will be the saviour of the children of Joseph, and I will make them come back again, for I have had mercy on them: they will be as if I had not given them up: for I am the Lord their God and I will give them an answer.

<sup>7</sup> And Ephraim will be like a man of war, and their hearts will be glad as with wine; and their children will see it with joy; their hearts will be glad in the Lord.

<sup>8</sup> With the sound of the pipe I will get them together; for I have given the price to make them free: and they will be increased as they were increased.

<sup>9</sup> Though I had them planted among the peoples, they will keep me in mind in far countries: and they will take care of their children and will come back.

<sup>10</sup> And I will make them come back out of the land of Egypt, and will get them together out of Assyria; and I will take them into the land of Gilead, and it will not be wide enough for them.

<sup>11</sup> And they will go through the sea of Egypt, and all the deep waters of the Nile will become dry: and the pride of Assyria will be made low, and the power of Egypt will be taken away.

<sup>12</sup> And their strength will be in the Lord; and their pride will be in his name, says the Lord.
