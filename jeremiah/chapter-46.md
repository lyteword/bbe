# Chapter 46

<sup>1</sup> The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet about the nations.

<sup>2</sup> Of Egypt: about the army of Pharaoh-neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, overcame in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah.

<sup>3</sup> Get out the breastplate and body-cover, and come together to the fight.

<sup>4</sup> Make the horses ready, and get up, you horsemen, and take your places with your head-dresses; make the spears sharp and put on the breastplates.

<sup>5</sup> What have I seen? they are overcome with fear and turned back; their men of war are broken and have gone in flight, not looking back: fear is on every side, says the Lord.

<sup>6</sup> Let not the quick-footed go in flight, or the man of war get away; on the north, by the river Euphrates, they are slipping and falling.

<sup>7</sup> Who is this coming up like the Nile, whose waters are lifting their heads like the rivers?

<sup>8</sup> Egypt is coming up like the Nile, and his waters are lifting their heads like the rivers, and he says, I will go up, covering the earth; I will send destruction on the town and its people.

<sup>9</sup> Go up, you horses; go rushing on, you carriages of war; go out, you men of war: Cush and Put, gripping the body-cover, and the Ludim, with bent bows.

<sup>10</sup> But that day is the day of the Lord, the Lord of armies, a day of punishment when he will take payment from his haters: and the sword will have all its desire, drinking their blood in full measure: for there is an offering to the Lord, the Lord of armies, in the north country by the river Euphrates.

<sup>11</sup> Go up to Gilead and take sweet oil, O virgin daughter of Egypt: there is no help in all your medical arts; nothing will make you well.

<sup>12</sup> Your shame has come to the ears of the nations, and the earth is full of your cry: for the strong man is falling against the strong, they have come down together.

<sup>13</sup> The word which the Lord said to Jeremiah the prophet, of how Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, would come and make war on the land of Egypt.

<sup>14</sup> Give the news in Migdol, make it public in Noph: say, Take up your positions and make yourselves ready; for on every side of you the sword has made destruction.

<sup>15</sup> Why has Apis, your strong one, gone in flight? he was not able to keep his place, because the Lord was forcing him down with strength.

<sup>16</sup> ... are stopped in their going, they are falling; and they say one to another, Let us get up and go back to our people, to the land of our birth, away from the cruel sword.

<sup>17</sup> Give a name to Pharaoh, king of Egypt: A noise who has let the time go by.

<sup>18</sup> By my life, says the King, whose name is the Lord of armies, truly, like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea, so will he come.

<sup>19</sup> O daughter living in Egypt, make ready the vessels of a prisoner: for Noph will become a waste, it will be burned up and become unpeopled.

<sup>20</sup> Egypt is a fair young cow; but a biting insect has come on her out of the north.

<sup>21</sup> And those who were her fighters for payment are like fat oxen; for they are turned back, they have gone in flight together, they do not keep their place: for the day of their fate has come on them, the time of their punishment.

<sup>22</sup> She makes a sound like the hiss of a snake when they come on with strength; they go against her with axes, like wood-cutters.

<sup>23</sup> They will be cutting down her woods, for they may not be searched out; because they are like locusts, more than may be numbered.

<sup>24</sup> The daughter of Egypt will be put to shame; she will be given up into the hands of the people of the north.

<sup>25</sup> The Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: See, I will send punishment on Amon of No and on Pharaoh and on those who put their faith in him;

<sup>26</sup> And I will give them up into the hands of those who will take their lives, and into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and into the hands of his servants: and later, it will be peopled as in the past, says the Lord.

<sup>27</sup> But have no fear, O Jacob, my servant, and do not be troubled, O Israel: for see, I will make you come back from far away, and your seed from the land where they are prisoners; and Jacob will come back, and will be quiet and in peace, and no one will give him cause for fear.

<sup>28</sup> Have no fear, O Jacob, my servant, says the Lord; for I am with you: for I will put an end to all the nations where I have sent you, but I will not put an end to you completely: though with wise purpose I will put right your errors, and will not let you go quite without punishment.
