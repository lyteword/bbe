# Psalm 105

<sup>1</sup> O give praise to the Lord; give honour to his name, talking of his doings among the peoples. 

<sup>2</sup> Let your voice be sounding in songs and melody; let all your thoughts be of the wonder of his works. 

<sup>3</sup> Have glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who are searching after the Lord be glad. 

<sup>4</sup> Let your search be for the Lord and for his strength; let your hearts ever be turned to him. 

<sup>5</sup> Keep in mind the great works which he has done; his wonders, and the decisions of his mouth; 

<sup>6</sup> O you seed of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob, his loved ones. 

<sup>7</sup> He is the Lord our God: he is judge of all the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> He has kept his agreement in mind for ever, the word which he gave for a thousand generations; 

<sup>9</sup> The agreement which he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac; 

<sup>10</sup> And he gave it to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an eternal agreement; 

<sup>11</sup> Saying, To you will I give the land of Canaan, the measured line of your heritage: 

<sup>12</sup> When they were still small in number, and strange in the land; 

<sup>13</sup> When they went about from one nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people. 

<sup>14</sup> He would not let anyone do them wrong; he even kept back kings because of them, 

<sup>15</sup> Saying, Put not your hand on those who have been marked with my holy oil, and do my prophets no wrong. 

<sup>16</sup> And he took away all food from the land, so that the people were without bread. 

<sup>17</sup> He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was given as a servant for a price: 

<sup>18</sup> His feet were fixed in chains; his neck was put in iron bands; 

<sup>19</sup> Till the time when his word came true; he was tested by the word of the Lord. 

<sup>20</sup> The king sent men to take off his chains; even the ruler of the people, who let him go free. 

<sup>21</sup> He made him lord of his house, and ruler over everything he had; 

<sup>22</sup> To give his chiefs teaching at his pleasure, and so that his law-givers might get wisdom from him. 

<sup>23</sup> Then Israel came into Egypt, and Jacob was living in the land of Ham. 

<sup>24</sup> And his people were greatly increased, and became stronger than those who were against them. 

<sup>25</sup> Their hearts were turned to hate against his people, so that they made secret designs against them. 

<sup>26</sup> He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, the man of his selection. 

<sup>27</sup> He let his signs be seen among the people, and his wonders in the land of Ham. 

<sup>28</sup> He sent black night and made it dark; and they did not go against his word. 

<sup>29</sup> At his word their waters were turned to blood, and he sent death on all their fish. 

<sup>30</sup> Their land was full of frogs, even in the rooms of the king. 

<sup>31</sup> He gave the word, and there came the dog-fly, and insects over all the land. 

<sup>32</sup> He gave them ice for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 

<sup>33</sup> He gave their vines and their fig-trees to destruction, and the trees of their land were broken down. 

<sup>34</sup> At his word the locusts came, and young locusts more than might be numbered, 

<sup>35</sup> And put an end to all the plants of their land, taking all the fruit of the earth for food. 

<sup>36</sup> He put to death the first child of every family in the land, the first-fruits of their strength. 

<sup>37</sup> He took his people out with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person among them. 

<sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they went; for the fear of them had come down on them. 

<sup>39</sup> A cloud was stretched over them for a cover; and he sent fire to give light in the night. 

<sup>40</sup> At the people's request he sent birds, and gave them the bread of heaven for food. 

<sup>41</sup> His hand made the rock open, and the waters came streaming out; they went down through the dry places like a river. 

<sup>42</sup> For he kept in mind his holy word, and Abraham, his servant. 

<sup>43</sup> And he took his people out with joy, the men of his selection with glad cries: 

<sup>44</sup> And gave them the lands of the nations; and they took the work of the peoples for a heritage; 

<sup>45</sup> So that they might keep his orders, and be true to his laws. Give praise to the Lord.
