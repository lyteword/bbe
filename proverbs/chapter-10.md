# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother. 

<sup>2</sup> Wealth which comes from sin is of no profit, but righteousness gives salvation from death. 

<sup>3</sup> The Lord will not let the upright be in need of food, but he puts far from him the desire of the evil-doers. 

<sup>4</sup> He who is slow in his work becomes poor, but the hand of the ready worker gets in wealth. 

<sup>5</sup> He who in summer gets together his store is a son who does wisely; but he who takes his rest when the grain is being cut is a son causing shame. 

<sup>6</sup> Blessings are on the head of the upright, but the face of sinners will be covered with sorrow. 

<sup>7</sup> The memory of the upright is a blessing, but the name of the evil-doer will be turned to dust. 

<sup>8</sup> The wise-hearted man will let himself be ruled, but the man whose talk is foolish will have a fall. 

<sup>9</sup> He whose ways are upright will go safely, but he whose ways are twisted will be made low. 

<sup>10</sup> He who makes signs with his eyes is a cause of trouble, but he who makes a man see his errors is a cause of peace. 

<sup>11</sup> The mouth of the upright man is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the evil-doer is a bitter cup. 

<sup>12</sup> Hate is a cause of violent acts, but all errors are covered up by love. 

<sup>13</sup> In the lips of him who has knowledge wisdom is seen; but a rod is ready for the back of him who is without sense. 

<sup>14</sup> Knowledge is stored up by the wise, but the mouth of the foolish man is a destruction which is near. 

<sup>15</sup> The property of the man of wealth is his strong town: the poor man's need is his destruction. 

<sup>16</sup> The work of the upright gives life: the increase of the evil-doer is a cause of sin. 

<sup>17</sup> He who takes note of teaching is a way of life, but he who gives up training is a cause of error. 

<sup>18</sup> Hate is covered up by the lips of the upright man, but he who lets out evil about another is foolish. 

<sup>19</sup> Where there is much talk there will be no end to sin, but he who keeps his mouth shut does wisely. 

<sup>20</sup> The tongue of the upright man is like tested silver: the heart of the evil-doer is of little value. 

<sup>21</sup> The lips of the upright man give food to men, but the foolish come to death for need of sense. 

<sup>22</sup> The blessing of the Lord gives wealth: hard work makes it no greater. 

<sup>23</sup> It is sport to the foolish man to do evil, but the man of good sense takes delight in wisdom. 

<sup>24</sup> The thing feared by the evil-doer will come to him, but the upright man will get his desire. 

<sup>25</sup> When the storm-wind is past, the sinner is seen no longer, but the upright man is safe for ever. 

<sup>26</sup> Like acid drink to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes, so is the hater of work to those who send him. 

<sup>27</sup> The fear of the Lord gives long life, but the years of the evil-doer will be cut short. 

<sup>28</sup> The hope of the upright man will give joy, but the waiting of the evil-doer will have its end in sorrow. 

<sup>29</sup> The way of the Lord is a strong tower for the upright man, but destruction to the workers of evil. 

<sup>30</sup> The upright man will never be moved, but evil-doers will not have a safe resting-place in the land. 

<sup>31</sup> The mouth of the upright man is budding with wisdom, but the twisted tongue will be cut off. 

<sup>32</sup> The lips of the upright man have knowledge of what is pleasing, but twisted are the mouths of evil-doers.
