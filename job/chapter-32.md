# Chapter 32

<sup>1</sup> So these three men gave no more answers to Job, because he seemed to himself to be right. 

<sup>2</sup> And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was angry, burning with wrath against Job, because he seemed to himself more right than God; 

<sup>3</sup> And he was angry with his three friends, because they had been unable to give him an answer, and had not made Job's sin clear. 

<sup>4</sup> Now Elihu had kept quiet while Job was talking, because they were older than he; 

<sup>5</sup> And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, he was very angry. 

<sup>6</sup> And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, made answer and said, I am young, and you are very old, so I was in fear, and kept myself from putting my knowledge before you. 

<sup>7</sup> I said to myself, It is right for the old to say what is in their minds, and for those who are far on in years to give out wisdom. 

<sup>8</sup> But truly it is the spirit in man, even the breath of the Ruler of all, which gives them knowledge. 

<sup>9</sup> It is not the old who are wise, and those who are full of years have not the knowledge of what is right. 

<sup>10</sup> So I say, Give ear to me, and I will put forward my knowledge. 

<sup>11</sup> I was waiting for your words, I was giving ear to your wise sayings; while you were searching out what to say, 

<sup>12</sup> I was taking note; and truly not one of you was able to make clear Job's error, or to give an answer to his words. 

<sup>13</sup> Take care that you do not say, Wisdom is here; God may overcome him, but not man. 

<sup>14</sup> I will not put forward words like these, or make use of your sayings in answer to him. 

<sup>15</sup> Fear has overcome them, they have no more answers to give; they have come to an end of words. 

<sup>16</sup> And am I to go on waiting while they have nothing to say? while they keep quiet and give no more answers? 

<sup>17</sup> I will give my answer; I will put forward my knowledge: 

<sup>18</sup> For I am full of words, I am unable to keep in my breath any longer: 

<sup>19</sup> My stomach is like wine which is unable to get out; like skins full of new wine, it is almost burst. 

<sup>20</sup> Let me say what is in my mind, so that I may get comfort; let me give answer with open mouth. 

<sup>21</sup> Let me not give respect to any man, or give names of honour to any living. 

<sup>22</sup> For I am not able to give names of honour to any man; and if I did, my Maker would quickly take me away.
