# Psalm 112

<sup>1</sup> Let the Lord be praised. Happy is the man who gives honour to the Lord, and has great delight in his laws.

<sup>2</sup> His seed will be strong on the earth; blessings will be on the generation of the upright.

<sup>3</sup> A store of wealth will be in his house, and his righteousness will be for ever.

<sup>4</sup> For the upright there is a light shining in the dark; he is full of grace and pity.

<sup>5</sup> All is well for the man who is kind and gives freely to others; he will make good his cause when he is judged.

<sup>6</sup> He will not ever be moved; the memory of the upright will be living for ever.

<sup>7</sup> He will have no fear of evil news; his heart is fixed, for his hope is in the Lord.

<sup>8</sup> His heart is resting safely, he will have no fear, till he sees trouble come on his haters.

<sup>9</sup> He has given with open hands to the poor; his righteousness is for ever; his horn will be lifted up with honour.

<sup>10</sup> The sinner will see it with grief; he will be wasted away with envy; the desire of the evil-doers will come to nothing.
