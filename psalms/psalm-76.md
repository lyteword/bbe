# Psalm 76

To the chief music-maker; put to Neginoth. A Psalm. Of Asaph. A Song.

**¹** In Judah is the knowledge of God; his name is great in Israel,

**²** In Salem is his tent, his resting-place in Zion.

**³** There were the arrows of the bow broken, there he put an end to body-cover, sword, and fight. (Selah.)

**⁴** You are shining and full of glory, more than the eternal mountains.

**⁵** Gone is the wealth of the strong, their last sleep has overcome them; the men of war have become feeble.

**⁶** At the voice of your wrath, O God of Jacob, deep sleep has overcome carriage and horse.

**⁷** You, you are to be feared; who may keep his place before you in the time of your wrath?

**⁸** From heaven you gave your decision; the earth, in its fear, gave no sound,

**⁹** When God took his place as judge, for the salvation of the poor on the earth. (Selah.)

**¹⁰** The ... will give you praise; the rest of ...

**¹¹** Give to the Lord your God what is his by right; let all who are round him give offerings to him who is to be feared.

**¹²** He puts an end to the wrath of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.
