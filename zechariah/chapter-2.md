# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> And lifting up my eyes, I saw a man with a measuring-line in his hand. 

<sup>2</sup> And I said to him, Where are you going? And he said to me, To take the measure of Jerusalem, to see how wide and how long it is. 

<sup>3</sup> And the angel who was talking to me went out, and another angel went out, and, meeting him, 

<sup>4</sup> Said to him, Go quickly and say to this young man, Jerusalem will be an unwalled town, because of the great number of men and cattle in her. 

<sup>5</sup> For I, says the Lord, will be a wall of fire round about her, and I will be the glory inside her. 

<sup>6</sup> Ho, ho! go in flight from the land of the north, says the Lord: for I have sent you far and wide to the four winds of heaven, says the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> Ho! Zion, go in flight from danger, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon. 

<sup>8</sup> For this is what the Lord of armies has said: In the way of glory he has sent me to the nations which have taken your goods: for anyone touching you is touching what is most dear to him. 

<sup>9</sup> For at the shaking of my hand over them, their goods will be taken by those who were their servants: and you will see that the Lord of armies has sent me. 

<sup>10</sup> Give songs of joy, O daughter of Zion: for I come, and I will make my resting-place among you, says the Lord. 

<sup>11</sup> And a number of nations will be joined to the Lord in that day, and will become my people; and I will be living among you, and you will see that the Lord of armies has sent me to you. 

<sup>12</sup> And Judah will be the Lord's heritage in the holy land, and Jerusalem will again be his. 

<sup>13</sup> Let all flesh be quiet and make no sound before the Lord: for he is awake and has come from his holy resting-place.
