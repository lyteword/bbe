# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> And Saul gave approval to his death. Now at that time a violent attack was started against the church in Jerusalem; and all but the Apostles went away into all parts of Judaea and Samaria. 

<sup>2</sup> And God-fearing men put Stephen's body in its last resting-place, making great weeping over him. 

<sup>3</sup> But Saul was burning with hate against the church, going into every house and taking men and women and putting them in prison. 

<sup>4</sup> But those who had gone in flight went everywhere preaching the word. 

<sup>5</sup> And Philip went down to Samaria and was teaching them about Christ. 

<sup>6</sup> And all the people gave attention to the words which Philip said, when they saw the signs which he did. 

<sup>7</sup> For unclean spirits came out from those who had them, crying with a loud voice; and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well. 

<sup>8</sup> And there was much joy in that town. 

<sup>9</sup> But there was a certain man named Simon, who in the past had been a wonder-worker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was a great man: 

<sup>10</sup> To whom they all gave attention, from the smallest to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is named Great. 

<sup>11</sup> And they gave attention to him, because for a long time his wonder-working powers had kept them under his control. 

<sup>12</sup> But when they had faith in the good news given by Philip about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, a number of men and women had baptism. 

<sup>13</sup> And Simon himself had faith and, having had baptism, he went with Philip and, seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did, he was full of surprise. 

<sup>14</sup> Now when the Apostles at Jerusalem had news that the people of Samaria had taken the word of God into their hearts, they sent to them Peter and John; 

<sup>15</sup> Who, when they came there, made prayer for them, that the Holy Spirit might be given to them: 

<sup>16</sup> For up to that time he had not come on any of them; only baptism had been given to them in the name of the Lord Jesus. 

<sup>17</sup> Then they put their hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came on them. 

<sup>18</sup> Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the touch of the Apostles' hands, he made them an offering of money, saying, 

<sup>19</sup> Give me this power, so that when I put my hands on anyone he may get the Holy Spirit. 

<sup>20</sup> But Peter said, May your money come to destruction with you, because you had the idea that what is freely given by God may be got for a price. 

<sup>21</sup> You have no part in this business, because your heart is not right before God. 

<sup>22</sup> Let your heart be changed, and make prayer to God that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts. 

<sup>23</sup> For I see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin. 

<sup>24</sup> And Simon, answering, said, Make prayer for me to the Lord, so that these things which you have said may not come on me. 

<sup>25</sup> So they, having given their witness and made clear the word of the Lord, went back to Jerusalem, giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of Samaria. 

<sup>26</sup> But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Get up, and go to the south, to the road which goes from Jerusalem to Gaza, through the waste land. 

<sup>27</sup> And he went and there was a man of Ethiopia, a servant of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and controller of all her property, who had come up to Jerusalem for worship; 

<sup>28</sup> He was going back, seated in his carriage, and was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah. 

<sup>29</sup> And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and get on his carriage. 

<sup>30</sup> And Philip, running up to him, saw that he was reading Isaiah the prophet, and said to him, Is the sense of what you are reading clear to you? 

<sup>31</sup> And he said, How is that possible when I have no guide? And he made Philip get up by his side. 

<sup>32</sup> Now the place in the book where he was reading was this: He was taken, like a sheep, to be put to death; and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut, so he made no sound: 

<sup>33</sup> Being of low degree, his cause was not given a hearing: who has knowledge of his family? for his life is cut off from the earth. 

<sup>34</sup> And the Ethiopian said to Philip, About whom are these words said by the prophet? about himself, or some other? 

<sup>35</sup> So Philip, starting from this writing, gave him the good news about Jesus. 

<sup>36</sup> And while they were going on their way, they came to some water, and the Ethiopian said, See, here is water; why may I not have baptism?
