# Psalm 140

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David. O Lord, take me out of the power of the evil man; keep me safe from the violent man: 

<sup>2</sup> For their hearts are full of evil designs; and they are ever making ready causes of war. 

<sup>3</sup> Their tongues are sharp like the tongue of a snake; the poison of snakes is under their lips. (Selah.) 

<sup>4</sup> O Lord, take me out of the hands of sinners; keep me safe from the violent man: for they are designing my downfall. 

<sup>5</sup> The men of pride have put secret cords for my feet; stretching nets in my way, so that they may take me with their tricks. (Selah.) 

<sup>6</sup> I have said to the Lord, You are my God: give ear, O Lord, to the voice of my prayer. 

<sup>7</sup> O Lord God, the strength of my salvation, you have been a cover over my head in the day of the fight. 

<sup>8</sup> O Lord, give not the wrongdoer his desire; give him no help in his evil designs, or he may be uplifted in pride. (Selah.) 

<sup>9</sup> As for those who come round me, let their heads be covered by the evil of their lips. 

<sup>10</sup> Let burning flames come down on them: let them be put into the fire, and into deep waters, so that they may not get up again. 

<sup>11</sup> Let not a man of evil tongue be safe on earth: let destruction overtake the violent man with blow on blow. 

<sup>12</sup> I am certain that the Lord will take care of the cause of the poor, and of the rights of those who are troubled. 

<sup>13</sup> Truly, the upright will give praise to your name: the holy will have a place in your house.
