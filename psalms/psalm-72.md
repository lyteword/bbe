# Psalm 72

<sup>1</sup> Of Solomon. Give the king your authority, O God, and your righteousness to the king's son. 

<sup>2</sup> May he be a judge of your people in righteousness, and make true decisions for the poor. 

<sup>3</sup> May the mountains give peace to the people, and the hills righteousness. 

<sup>4</sup> May he be a judge of the poor among the people, may he give salvation to the children of those who are in need; by him let the violent be crushed. 

<sup>5</sup> May his life go on as long as the sun and moon, through all generations. 

<sup>6</sup> May he come down like rain on the cut grass; like showers watering the earth. 

<sup>7</sup> In his days may the upright do well, living in peace as long as there is a moon in heaven. 

<sup>8</sup> Let his kingdom be from sea to sea, from the River to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> Let those who are against him go down before him; and let his haters be low in the dust. 

<sup>10</sup> Let the kings of Tarshish and of the islands come back with offerings; let the kings of Sheba and Seba give of their stores. 

<sup>11</sup> Yes, let all kings go down before him; let all nations be his servants. 

<sup>12</sup> For he will be a saviour to the poor in answer to his cry; and to him who is in need, without a helper. 

<sup>13</sup> He will have pity on the poor, and be the saviour of those who are in need. 

<sup>14</sup> He will keep their souls free from evil designs and violent attacks; and their blood will be of value in his eyes. 

<sup>15</sup> May he have long life, and may gold from Sheba be given to him: may prayers be made for him at all times; may blessings be on him every day. 

<sup>16</sup> May there be wide-stretching fields of grain in the land, shaking on the top of the mountains, full of fruit like Lebanon: may its stems be unnumbered like the grass of the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> May his name go on for ever, as long as the sun: may men be blessing themselves by him; may all nations be blessing his name. 

<sup>18</sup> Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel, the only doer of wonders. 

<sup>19</sup> Praise to the glory of his noble name for ever; let all the earth be full of his glory. So be it, So be it. 

<sup>20</sup> The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.
