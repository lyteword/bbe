**¹** Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: these are the sons which they had after the great flow of waters

**²** The sons of Japheth: Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.

**³** And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.

**⁴** And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, the Kittim and the Dodanim.

**⁵** From these came the nations of the sea-lands, with their different families and languages.

**⁶** And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.

**⁷** And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.

**⁸** And Cush was the father of Nimrod, who was the first of the great men of the earth.

**⁹** He was a very great bowman, so that there is a saying, Like Nimrod, a very great bowman.

**¹⁰** And at the first, his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

**¹¹** From that land he went out into Assyria, building Nineveh with its wide streets and Calah,

**¹²** And Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which is a very great town.

**¹³** And Mizraim was the father of the Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim;

**¹⁴** And Pathrusim and Casluhim and Caphtorim, from whom came the Philistines.

**¹⁵** And Canaan was the father of Zidon, who was his oldest son, and Heth,

**¹⁶** And the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite,

**¹⁷** And the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite,

**¹⁸** And the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; after that the families of the Canaanites went far and wide in all directions;

**¹⁹** Their country stretching from Zidon to Gaza, in the direction of Gerar; and to Lasha, in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim.

**²⁰** All these, with their different families, languages, lands, and nations, are the offspring of Ham.

**²¹** And Shem, the older brother of Japheth, the father of the children of Eber, had other sons in addition.

**²²** These are the sons of Shem: Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.

**²³** And the sons of Aram: Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.

**²⁴** And Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.

**²⁵** And Eber had two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, because in his time the peoples of the earth became separate; and his brother's name was Joktan.

**²⁶** And Joktan was the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah

**²⁷** And Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah

**²⁸** And Obal and Abimael and Sheba

**²⁹** And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.

**³⁰** And their country was from Mesha, in the direction of Sephar, the mountain of the east.

**³¹** These, with their families and their languages and their lands and their nations, are the offspring of Shem.

**³²** These are the families of the sons of Noah, in the order of their generations and their nations: from these came all the nations of the earth after the great flow of waters.
