# Psalm 83

A Song. A Psalm. Of Asaph.

**¹** O God, do not keep quiet: let your lips be open and take no rest, O God.

**²** For see! those who make war on you are out of control; your haters are lifting up their heads.

**³** They have made wise designs against your people, talking together against those whom you keep in a secret place.

**⁴** They have said, Come, let us put an end to them as a nation; so that the name of Israel may go out of man's memory.

**⁵** For they have all come to an agreement; they are all joined together against you:

**⁶** The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagarites;

**⁷** Gebal and Ammon and Amalek; the Philistines and the people of Tyre;

**⁸** Assur is joined with them; they have become the support of the children of Lot. (Selah.)

**⁹** Do to them what you did to the Midianites; what you did to Sisera and Jabin, at the stream of Kishon:

**¹⁰** Who came to destruction at En-dor; their bodies became dust and waste.

**¹¹** Make their chiefs like Oreb and Zeeb; and all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna:

**¹²** Who have said, Let us take for our heritage the resting-place of God.

**¹³** O my God, make them like the rolling dust; like dry stems before the wind.

**¹⁴** As fire burning a wood, and as a flame causing fire on the mountains,

**¹⁵** So go after them with your strong wind, and let them be full of fear because of your storm.

**¹⁶** Let their faces be full of shame; so that they may give honour to your name, O Lord.

**¹⁷** Let them be overcome and troubled for ever; let them be put to shame and come to destruction;

**¹⁸** So that men may see that you only, whose name is Yahweh, are Most High over all the earth.
