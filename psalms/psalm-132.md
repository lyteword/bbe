# Psalm 132 

A Song of the going up.

**¹** Lord, give thought to David, and to all his troubles;

**²** How he made an oath to the Lord, and gave his word to the great God of Jacob, saying,

**³** Truly, I will not come into my house, or go to my bed,

**⁴** I will not give sleep to my eyes, or rest to my eyeballs,

**⁵** Till I have got a place for the Lord, a resting-place for the great God of Jacob.

**⁶** We had news of it at Ephrathah: we came to it in the fields of the wood.

**⁷** Let us go into his tent; let us give worship at his feet.

**⁸** Come back, O Lord, to your resting-place; you and the ark of your strength.

**⁹** Let your priests be clothed with righteousness; and let your saints give cries of joy.

**¹⁰** Because of your servant David, do not give up your king.

**¹¹** The Lord gave a true oath to David, which he will not take back, saying, I will give your kingdom to the fruit of your body.

**¹²** If your children keep my word, and the teachings which I will give them, their children will be rulers of your kingdom for ever.

**¹³** For the Lord's heart is on Zion, desiring it for his resting-place.

**¹⁴** This is my rest for ever: here will I ever be; for this is my desire.

**¹⁵** My blessing will be on her food; and her poor will be full of bread.

**¹⁶** Her priests will be clothed with salvation; and her saints will give cries of joy.

**¹⁷** There I will make the horn of David fertile: I have made ready a light for my king.

**¹⁸** His haters will be clothed with shame; but I will make his crown shining.
