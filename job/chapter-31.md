# Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> I made an agreement with my eyes; how then might my eyes be looking on a virgin? 

<sup>2</sup> For what is God's reward from on high, or the heritage given by the Ruler of all from heaven? 

<sup>3</sup> Is it not trouble for the sinner, and destruction for the evil-doers? 

<sup>4</sup> Does he not see my ways, and are not my steps all numbered? 

<sup>5</sup> If I have gone in false ways, or my foot has been quick in working deceit; 

<sup>6</sup> (Let me be measured in upright scales, and let God see my righteousness:) 

<sup>7</sup> If my steps have been turned out of the way, or if my heart went after my eyes, or if the property of another is in my hands; 

<sup>8</sup> Let me put seed in the earth for another to have the fruit of it, and let my produce be uprooted. 

<sup>9</sup> If my heart went after another man's wife, or if I was waiting secretly at my neighbour's door; 

<sup>10</sup> Then let my wife give pleasure to another man and let others make use of her body. 

<sup>11</sup> For that would be a crime; it would be an act for which punishment would be measured out by the judges: 

<sup>12</sup> It would be a fire burning even to destruction, and taking away all my produce. 

<sup>13</sup> If I did wrong in the cause of my man-servant, or my woman-servant, when they went to law with me; 

<sup>14</sup> What then will I do when God comes as my judge? and what answer may I give to his questions? 

<sup>15</sup> Did not God make him as well as me? did he not give us life in our mothers' bodies? 

<sup>16</sup> If I kept back the desire of the poor; if the widow's eye was looking for help to no purpose; 

<sup>17</sup> If I kept my food for myself, and did not give some of it to the child with no father; 

<sup>18</sup> (For I was cared for by God as by a father from my earliest days; he was my guide from the body of my mother;) 

<sup>19</sup> If I saw one near to death for need of clothing, and that the poor had nothing covering him; 

<sup>20</sup> If his back did not give me a blessing, and the wool of my sheep did not make him warm; 

<sup>21</sup> If my hand had been lifted up against him who had done no wrong, when I saw that I was supported by the judges; 

<sup>22</sup> May my arm be pulled from my body, and be broken from its base. 

<sup>23</sup> For the fear of God kept me back, and because of his power I might not do such things. 

<sup>24</sup> If I made gold my hope, or if I ever said to the best gold, I have put my faith in you; 

<sup>25</sup> If I was glad because my wealth was great, and because my hand had got together a great store; 

<sup>26</sup> If, when I saw the sun shining, and the moon moving on its bright way, 

<sup>27</sup> A secret feeling of worship came into my heart, and my hand gave kisses from my mouth; 

<sup>28</sup> That would have been another sin to be rewarded with punishment by the judges; for I would have been false to God on high. 

<sup>29</sup> If I was glad at the trouble of my hater, and gave cries of joy when evil overtook him; 

<sup>30</sup> (For I did not let my mouth give way to sin, in putting a curse on his life;) 

<sup>31</sup> If the men of my tent did not say, Who has not had full measure of his meat? 

<sup>32</sup> The traveller did not take his night's rest in the street, and my doors were open to anyone on a journey; 

<sup>33</sup> If I kept my evil doings covered, and my sin in the secret of my breast, 

<sup>34</sup> For fear of the great body of people, or for fear that families might make sport of me, so that I kept quiet, and did not go out of my door; 

<sup>35</sup> If only God would give ear to me, and the Ruler of all would give me an answer! or if what he has against me had been put in writing! 

<sup>36</sup> Truly I would take up the book in my hands; it would be to me as a crown; 

<sup>37</sup> I would make clear the number of my steps, I would put it before him like a prince! The words of Job are ended. 

<sup>38</sup> If my land has made an outcry against me, or the ploughed earth has been in sorrow; 

<sup>39</sup> If I have taken its produce without payment, causing the death of its owners; 

<sup>40</sup> Then in place of grain let thorns come up, and in place of barley evil-smelling plants.
