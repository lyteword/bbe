# Psalm 14

To the chief music-maker. Of David.

<sup>1</sup> The foolish man has said in his heart, God will not do anything. They are unclean, they have done evil works; there is not one who does good.

<sup>2</sup> The Lord was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God.

<sup>3</sup> They have all gone out of the way together; they are unclean, there is not one who does good, no, not one.

<sup>4</sup> Have all the workers of evil no knowledge? they take my people for food as they would take bread; they make no prayer to the Lord.

<sup>5</sup> Then were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the upright.

<sup>6</sup> You have put to shame the thoughts of the poor, but the Lord is his support.

<sup>7</sup> May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! when the fate of his people is changed by the Lord, Jacob will have joy and Israel will be glad.
