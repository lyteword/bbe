# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> And in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the waste land of Judaea, 

<sup>2</sup> Saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin; for the kingdom of heaven is near. 

<sup>3</sup> For this is he of whom Isaiah the prophet said, The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight. 

<sup>4</sup> Now John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather band about him; and his food was locusts and honey. 

<sup>5</sup> Then Jerusalem and all Judaea went out to him, and all the people from near Jordan; 

<sup>6</sup> And they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan, saying openly that they had done wrong. 

<sup>7</sup> But when he saw a number of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of snakes, at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come? 

<sup>8</sup> Let your change of heart be seen in your works: 

<sup>9</sup> And say not to yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; because I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children for Abraham. 

<sup>10</sup> And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees; every tree then which does not give good fruit is cut down, and put into the fire. 

<sup>11</sup> Truly, I give baptism with water to those of you whose hearts are changed; but he who comes after me is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to take up: he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire: 

<sup>12</sup> In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain; he will put the good grain in his store, but the waste will be burned up in the fire which will never be put out. 

<sup>13</sup> Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be given baptism by him. 

<sup>14</sup> But John would have kept him back, saying, It is I who have need of baptism from you, and do you come to me? 

<sup>15</sup> But Jesus made answer, saying to him, Let it be so now: because so it is right for us to make righteousness complete. Then he gave him baptism. 

<sup>16</sup> And Jesus, having been given baptism, straight away went up from the water; and, the heavens opening, he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him as a dove; 

<sup>17</sup> And a voice came out of heaven, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased.
