# Psalm 100

A Psalm of Praise.

**¹** Make a glad sound to the Lord, all the earth.

**²** Give worship to the Lord with joy; come before him with a song.

**³** Be certain that the Lord is God; it is he who has made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep to whom he gives food.

**⁴** Come into his doors with joy, and into his house with praise; give him honour, blessing his name.

**⁵** For the Lord is good, and his mercy is never-ending; his faith is unchanging through all generations.
