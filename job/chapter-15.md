# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value, or will he give birth to the east wind? 

<sup>3</sup> Will he make arguments with words in which is no profit, and with sayings which have no value? 

<sup>4</sup> Truly, you make the fear of God without effect, so that the time of quiet worship before God is made less by your outcry. 

<sup>5</sup> For your mouth is guided by your sin, and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself. 

<sup>6</sup> It is by your mouth, even yours, that you are judged to be in the wrong, and not by me; and your lips give witness against you. 

<sup>7</sup> Were you the first man to come into the world? or did you come into being before the hills? 

<sup>8</sup> Were you present at the secret meeting of God? and have you taken all wisdom for yourself? 

<sup>9</sup> What knowledge have you which we have not? is there anything in your mind which is not in ours? 

<sup>10</sup> With us are men who are grey-haired and full of years, much older than your father. 

<sup>11</sup> Are the comforts of God not enough for you, and the gentle word which was said to you? 

<sup>12</sup> Why is your heart uncontrolled, and why are your eyes lifted up; 

<sup>13</sup> So that you are turning your spirit against God, and letting such words go out of your mouth? 

<sup>14</sup> What is man, that he may be clean? and how may the son of woman be upright? 

<sup>15</sup> Truly, he puts no faith in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his eyes; 

<sup>16</sup> How much less one who is disgusting and unclean, a man who takes in evil like water! 

<sup>17</sup> Take note and give ear to my words; and I will say what I have seen: 

<sup>18</sup> (The things which wise men have got from their fathers, and have not kept secret from us; 

<sup>19</sup> For only to them was the land given, and no strange people were among them:) 

<sup>20</sup> The evil man is in pain all his days, and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small. 

<sup>21</sup> A sound of fear is in his ears; in time of peace destruction will come on him: 

<sup>22</sup> He has no hope of coming safe out of the dark, and his fate will be the sword; 

<sup>23</sup> He is wandering about in search of bread, saying, Where is it? and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him: 

<sup>24</sup> He is greatly in fear of the dark day, trouble and pain overcome him: 

<sup>25</sup> Because his hand is stretched out against God, and his heart is lifted up against the Ruler of all, 

<sup>26</sup> Running against him like a man of war, covered by his thick breastplate; even like a king ready for the fight, 

<sup>27</sup> Because his face is covered with fat, and his body has become thick; 

<sup>28</sup> And he has made his resting-place in the towns which have been pulled down, in houses where no man had a right to be, whose fate was to become masses of broken walls. 

<sup>29</sup> He does not get wealth for himself, and is unable to keep what he has got; the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth. 

<sup>30</sup> He does not come out of the dark; his branches are burned by the flame, and the wind takes away his bud. 

<sup>31</sup> Let him not put his hope in what is false, falling into error: for he will get deceit as his reward. 

<sup>32</sup> His branch is cut off before its time, and his leaf is no longer green. 

<sup>33</sup> He is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth, or an olive-tree dropping its flowers. 

<sup>34</sup> For the band of the evil-doers gives no fruit, and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire. 

<sup>35</sup> Evil has made them with child, and they give birth to trouble; and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves.
