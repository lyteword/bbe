# Psalm 7

<sup>1</sup> Shiggaion of David; a song which he made to the Lord, about the words of Cush the Benjamite. O Lord my God, I put my faith in you; take me out of the hands of him who is cruel to me, and make me free; 

<sup>2</sup> So that he may not come rushing on my soul like a lion, wounding it, while there is no one to be my saviour. 

<sup>3</sup> O Lord my God, if I have done this; if my hands have done any wrong; 

<sup>4</sup> If I have given back evil to him who did evil to me, or have taken anything from him who was against me without cause; 

<sup>5</sup> Let my hater go after my soul and take it; let my life be crushed to the earth, and my honour into the dust. (Selah.) 

<sup>6</sup> Come up, Lord, in your wrath; be lifted up against my haters; be awake, my God, give orders for the judging. 

<sup>7</sup> The meeting of the nations will be round you; take your seat, then, over them, on high. 

<sup>8</sup> The Lord will be judge of the peoples; give a decision for me, O Lord, because of my righteousness, and let my virtue have its reward. 

<sup>9</sup> O let the evil of the evil-doer come to an end, but give strength to the upright: for men's minds and hearts are tested by the God of righteousness. 

<sup>10</sup> God, who is the saviour of the upright in heart, is my breastplate. 

<sup>11</sup> God is the judge of the upright, and is angry with the evil-doers every day. 

<sup>12</sup> If a man is not turned from his evil, he will make his sword sharp; his bow is bent and ready. 

<sup>13</sup> He has made ready for him the instruments of death; he makes his arrows flames of fire. 

<sup>14</sup> That man is a worker of evil; the seed of wrongdoing has given birth to deceit. 

<sup>15</sup> He has made a hole deep in the earth, and is falling into the hole which he has made 

<sup>16</sup> His wrongdoing will come back to him, and his violent behaviour will come down on his head. 

<sup>17</sup> I will give praise to the Lord for his righteousness; I will make a song to the name of the Lord Most High.
