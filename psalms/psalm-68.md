# Psalm 68

To the chief music-maker. Of David. A Psalm. A Song.

**¹** Let God be seen, and let his haters be put to flight; let those who are against him be turned back before him.

**²** Let them be like smoke before the driving wind; as wax turning soft before the fire, so let them come to an end before the power of God.

**³** But let the upright be glad; let them have delight before God; let them be full of joy.

**⁴** Make songs to God, make songs of praise to his name; make a way for him who comes through the waste lands; his name is Jah; be glad before him.

**⁵** A father to those who have no father, a judge of the widows, is God in his holy place.

**⁶** Those who are without friends, God puts in families; he makes free those who are in chains; but those who are turned away from him are given a dry land.

**⁷** O God, when you went out before your people, wandering through the waste land; (Selah.)

**⁸** The earth was shaking and the heavens were streaming, because God was present; even Sinai itself was moved before God, the God of Israel.

**⁹** You, O God, did freely send the rain, giving strength to the weariness of your heritage.

**¹⁰** Those whose resting-place was there, even the poor, were comforted by your good things, O God.

**¹¹** The Lord gives the word; great is the number of the women who make it public.

**¹²** Kings of armies quickly go in flight: and the women in the houses make a division of their goods.

**¹³** Will you take your rest among the flocks? like the wings of a dove covered with silver, and its feathers with yellow gold.

**¹⁴** When the Most High put the kings to flight, it was as white as snow in Salmon.

**¹⁵** A hill of God is the hill of Bashan; a hill with high tops is the hill of Bashan.

**¹⁶** Why are you looking with envy, you high hills, on the hill desired by God as his resting-place? truly, God will make it his house for ever.

**¹⁷** The war-carriage of God is among Israel's thousands; the Lord has come from Sinai to the holy place.

**¹⁸** You have gone up on high, taking your prisoners with you; you have taken offerings from men; the Lord God has taken his place on the seat of his power.

**¹⁹** Praise be to the Lord, who is our support day by day, even the God of our salvation. (Selah.)

**²⁰** Our God is for us a God of salvation; his are the ways out of death.

**²¹** The heads of the haters of God will be crushed; even the head of him who still goes on in his evil ways.

**²²** The Lord said, I will make them come back from Bashan, and from the deep parts of the sea;

**²³** So that your foot may be red with blood, and the tongues of your dogs with the same.

**²⁴** We see your going, O God: even the going of my God, my King, into the holy place.

**²⁵** The makers of songs go before, the players of music come after, among the young girls playing on brass instruments.

**²⁶** Give praise to God in the great meeting; even the Lord, you who come from the fountain of Israel.

**²⁷** There is little Benjamin ruling them, the chiefs of Judah and their army, the rulers of Zebulun and the rulers of Naphtali.

**²⁸** O God, send out your strength; the strength, O God, with which you have done great things for us,

**²⁹** Out of your Temple in Jerusalem.

**³⁰** Say sharp words to the beast among the water-plants, the band of strong ones, with the lords of the peoples, put an end to the people whose delight is in war.

**³¹** Kings will give you offerings, they will come out of Egypt; from Pathros will come offerings of silver; Ethiopia will be stretching out her hands to God.

**³²** Make songs to God, you kingdoms of the earth; O make songs of praise to the Lord; (Selah.)

**³³** To him who goes or the clouds of heaven, the heaven which was from earliest times; he sends out his voice of power.

**³⁴** Make clear that strength is God's: he is lifted up over Israel, and his power is in the clouds.

**³⁵** O God, you are to be feared in your holy place: the God of Israel gives strength and power to his people. Praise be to God.
