# Psalm 133

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. Of David. See how good and how pleasing it is for brothers to be living together in harmony! 

<sup>2</sup> It is like oil of great price on the head, flowing down over the face, even Aaron's face: coming down to the edge of his robe; 

<sup>3</sup> Like the dew of Hermon, which comes down on the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord gave orders for the blessing, even life for ever.
