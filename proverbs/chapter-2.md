# Proverbs 2 

**¹** My son, if you will take my words to your heart, storing up my laws in your mind;

**²** So that your ear gives attention to wisdom, and your heart is turned to knowledge;

**³** Truly, if you are crying out for good sense, and your request is for knowledge;

**⁴** If you are looking for her as for silver, and searching for her as for stored-up wealth;

**⁵** Then the fear of the Lord will be clear to you, and knowledge of God will be yours.

**⁶** For the Lord gives wisdom; out of his mouth come knowledge and reason:

**⁷** He has salvation stored up for the upright, he is a breastplate to those in whom there is no evil;

**⁸** He keeps watch on the ways which are right, and takes care of those who have the fear of him.

**⁹** Then you will have knowledge of righteousness and right acting, and upright behaviour, even of every good way.

**¹⁰** For wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul;

**¹¹** Wise purposes will be watching over you, and knowledge will keep you;

**¹²** Giving you salvation from the evil man, from those whose words are false;

**¹³** Who give up the way of righteousness, to go by dark roads;

**¹⁴** Who take pleasure in wrongdoing, and have joy in the evil designs of the sinner;

**¹⁵** Whose ways are not straight, and whose footsteps are turned to evil:

**¹⁶** To take you out of the power of the strange woman, who says smooth words with her tongue;

**¹⁷** Who is false to the husband of her early years, and does not keep the agreement of her God in mind:

**¹⁸** For her house is on the way down to death; her footsteps go down to the shades:

**¹⁹** Those who go to her do not come back again; their feet do not keep in the ways of life:

**²⁰** So that you may go in the way of good men, and keep in the footsteps of the upright.

**²¹** For the upright will be living in the land, and the good will have it for their heritage.

**²²** But sinners will be cut off from the land, and those whose acts are false will be uprooted.
