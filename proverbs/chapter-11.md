# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Scales of deceit are hated by the Lord, but a true weight is his delight. 

<sup>2</sup> When pride comes, there comes shame, but wisdom is with the quiet in spirit. 

<sup>3</sup> The righteousness of the upright will be their guide, but the twisted ways of the false will be their destruction. 

<sup>4</sup> Wealth is of no profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness keeps a man safe from death. 

<sup>5</sup> The righteousness of the good man will make his way straight, but the sin of the evil-doer will be the cause of his fall. 

<sup>6</sup> The righteousness of the upright will be their salvation, but the false will themselves be taken in their evil designs. 

<sup>7</sup> At the death of an upright man his hope does not come to an end, but the hope of the evil-doer comes to destruction. 

<sup>8</sup> The upright man is taken out of trouble, and in his place comes the sinner. 

<sup>9</sup> With his mouth the evil man sends destruction on his neighbour; but through knowledge the upright are taken out of trouble. 

<sup>10</sup> When things go well for the upright man, all the town is glad; at the death of sinners, there are cries of joy. 

<sup>11</sup> By the blessing of the upright man the town is made great, but it is overturned by the mouth of the evil-doer. 

<sup>12</sup> He who has a poor opinion of his neighbour has no sense, but a wise man keeps quiet. 

<sup>13</sup> He who goes about talking of others makes secrets public, but the true-hearted man keeps things covered. 

<sup>14</sup> When there is no helping suggestion the people will have a fall, but with a number of wise guides they will be safe. 

<sup>15</sup> He who makes himself responsible for a strange man will undergo much loss; but the hater of such undertakings will be safe. 

<sup>16</sup> A woman who is full of grace is honoured, but a woman hating righteousness is a seat of shame: those hating work will undergo loss, but the strong keep their wealth. 

<sup>17</sup> The man who has mercy will be rewarded, but the cruel man is the cause of trouble to himself. 

<sup>18</sup> The sinner gets the payment of deceit; but his reward is certain who puts in the seed of righteousness. 

<sup>19</sup> So righteousness gives life; but he who goes after evil gets death for himself. 

<sup>20</sup> The uncontrolled are hated by the Lord, but those whose ways are without error are his delight 

<sup>21</sup> Certainly the evil-doer will not go free from punishment, but the seed of the upright man will be safe. 

<sup>22</sup> Like a ring of gold in the nose of a pig, is a beautiful woman who has no sense. 

<sup>23</sup> The desire of the upright man is only for good, but wrath is waiting for the evil-doer. 

<sup>24</sup> A man may give freely, and still his wealth will be increased; and another may keep back more than is right, but only comes to be in need. 

<sup>25</sup> He who gives blessing will be made fat, but the curser will himself be cursed. 

<sup>26</sup> He who keeps back grain will be cursed by the people; but a blessing will be on the head of him who lets them have it for a price. 

<sup>27</sup> He who, with all his heart, goes after what is good is searching for grace; but he who is looking for trouble will get it. 

<sup>28</sup> He who puts his faith in wealth will come to nothing; but the upright man will be full of growth like the green leaf. 

<sup>29</sup> The troubler of his house will have the wind for his heritage, and the foolish will be servant to the wise-hearted. 

<sup>30</sup> The fruit of righteousness is a tree of life, but violent behaviour takes away souls. 

<sup>31</sup> If the upright man is rewarded on earth, how much more the evil-doer and the sinner!
