# Psalm 128

A Song of the going up.

<sup>1</sup> Happy is the worshipper of the Lord, who is walking in his ways.

<sup>2</sup> You will have the fruit of the work of your hands: happy will you be, and all will be well for you.

<sup>3</sup> Your wife will be like a fertile vine in the inmost parts of your house: your children will be like olive plants round your table.

<sup>4</sup> See! this is the blessing of the worshipper of the Lord.

<sup>5</sup> May the Lord send you blessing out of Zion: may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.

<sup>6</sup> May you see your children's children. Peace be on Israel.
