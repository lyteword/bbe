# Psalm 85

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of the sons of Korah. Lord, you were good to your land: changing the fate of Jacob. 

<sup>2</sup> The wrongdoing of your people had forgiveness; all their sin had been covered. (Selah.) 

<sup>3</sup> You were no longer angry: you were turned from the heat of your wrath. 

<sup>4</sup> Come back to us, O God of our salvation, and be angry with us no longer. 

<sup>5</sup> Will you go on being angry with us for ever? will you keep your wrath against us through all the long generations? 

<sup>6</sup> Will you not give us life again, so that your people may be glad in you? 

<sup>7</sup> Let us see your mercy, O Lord, and give us your salvation. 

<sup>8</sup> I will give ear to the voice of the Lord; for he will say words of peace to his people and to his saints; but let them not go back to their foolish ways. 

<sup>9</sup> Truly, his salvation is near to his worshippers; so that glory may be in our land. 

<sup>10</sup> Mercy and faith have come together; righteousness and peace have given one another a kiss. 

<sup>11</sup> Faith comes up from the earth like a plant; righteousness is looking down from heaven. 

<sup>12</sup> The Lord will give what is good; and our land will give its increase. 

<sup>13</sup> Righteousness will go before him, making a way for his footsteps.
