# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 

<sup>2</sup> Now in Jerusalem near the sheep-market there is a public bath which in Hebrew is named Beth-zatha. It has five doorways. 

<sup>3</sup> In these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases: some unable to see, some without the power of walking, some with wasted bodies.
