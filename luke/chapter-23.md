# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> And they all went and took him before Pilate. 

<sup>2</sup> And they made statements against him, saying, This man has to our knowledge been teaching our nation to do wrong, and not to make payment of taxes to Caesar, even saying that he himself is Christ, a king. 

<sup>3</sup> And Pilate said to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he said in answer, You say so. 

<sup>4</sup> And Pilate said to the chief priests and the people, In my opinion this man has done no wrong. 

<sup>5</sup> But they became more violent than before, saying, He has made trouble among the people, teaching through all Judaea from Galilee to this place. 

<sup>6</sup> But at these words Pilate said, Is the man a Galilaean? 

<sup>7</sup> And when he saw that he was under the authority of Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was in Jerusalem himself at that time. 

<sup>8</sup> Now when Herod saw Jesus he was very glad, having for a long time had a desire to see him, for he had had accounts of him, and was hoping to see some wonders done by him. 

<sup>9</sup> And he put a great number of questions to him, but he said nothing. 

<sup>10</sup> And the chief priests and the scribes were there, making statements against him violently. 

<sup>11</sup> And Herod, with the men of his army, put shame on him and made sport of him, and dressing him in shining robes, he sent him back to Pilate. 

<sup>12</sup> And that day Herod and Pilate became friends with one another, for before they had been against one another. 

<sup>13</sup> And Pilate sent for the chief priests and the rulers and the people, and said to them, 

<sup>14</sup> You say that this man has been teaching the people evil things: now I, after going into the question before you, see nothing wrong in this man in connection with the things which you have said against him: 

<sup>15</sup> And Herod is of the same opinion, for he has sent him back to us; for, you see, he has done nothing for which I might put him to death. 

<sup>16</sup> And so I will give him punishment and let him go.
