# Psalm 88

<sup>1</sup> A Song. A Psalm. Of the sons of Korah. To the chief music-maker; put to Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil. Of Heman the Ezrahite. O Lord, God of my salvation, I have been crying to you for help by day and by night: 

<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer come before you; give ear to my cry: 

<sup>3</sup> For my soul is full of evils, and my life has come near to the underworld. 

<sup>4</sup> I am numbered among those who go down into the earth; I have become like a man for whom there is no help: 

<sup>5</sup> My soul is among the dead, like those in the underworld, to whom you give no more thought; for they are cut off from your care. 

<sup>6</sup> You have put me in the lowest deep, even in dark places. 

<sup>7</sup> The weight of your wrath is crushing me, all your waves have overcome me. (Selah.) 

<sup>8</sup> You have sent my friends far away from me; you have made me a disgusting thing in their eyes: I am shut up, and not able to come out. 

<sup>9</sup> My eyes are wasting away because of my trouble: Lord, my cry has gone up to you every day, my hands are stretched out to you. 

<sup>10</sup> Will you do works of wonder for the dead? will the shades come back to give you praise? (Selah.) 

<sup>11</sup> Will the story of your mercy be given in the house of the dead? will news of your faith come to the place of destruction? 

<sup>12</sup> May there be knowledge of your wonders in the dark? or of your righteousness where memory is dead? 

<sup>13</sup> But to you did I send up my cry, O Lord; in the morning my prayer came before you. 

<sup>14</sup> Lord, why have you sent away my soul? why is your face covered from me? 

<sup>15</sup> I have been troubled and in fear of death from the time when I was young; your wrath is hard on me, and I have no strength. 

<sup>16</sup> The heat of your wrath has gone over me; I am broken by your cruel punishments. 

<sup>17</sup> They are round me all the day like water; they have made a circle about me. 

<sup>18</sup> You have sent my friends and lovers far from me; I am gone from the memory of those who are dear to me.
