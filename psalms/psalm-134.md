# Psalm 134

A Song of the going up.

<sup>1</sup> Give praise to the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who take your places in the house of the Lord by night.

<sup>2</sup> Give praise to the Lord, lifting up your hands in his holy place.

<sup>3</sup> May the Lord, who made heaven and earth, send you blessing out of Zion,
