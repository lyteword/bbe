# Psalm 26

Of David.

**¹** O Lord, be my judge, for my behaviour has been upright: I have put my faith in the Lord, I am not in danger of slipping.

**²** Put me in the scales, O Lord, so that I may be tested; let the fire make clean my thoughts and my heart.

**³** For your mercy is before my eyes; and I have gone in the way of your good faith.

**⁴** I have not taken my seat with foolish persons, and I do not go with false men.

**⁵** I have been a hater of the band of wrongdoers, and I will not be seated among sinners.

**⁶** I will make my hands clean from sin; so will I go round your altar, O Lord;

**⁷** That I may give out the voice of praise, and make public all the wonders which you have done.

**⁸** Lord, your house has been dear to me, and the resting-place of your glory.

**⁹** Let not my soul be numbered among sinners, or my life among men of blood;

**¹⁰** In whose hands are evil designs, and whose right hands take money for judging falsely.

**¹¹** But as for me, I will go on in my upright ways: be my saviour, and have mercy on me.

**¹²** I have a safe resting-place for my feet; I will give praise to the Lord in the meetings of the people.
