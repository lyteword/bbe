# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> Make two silver horns of hammered work, to be used for getting the people together and to give the sign for the moving of the tents. 

<sup>3</sup> When they are sounded, all the people are to come together to you at the door of the Tent of meeting. 

<sup>4</sup> If only one of them is sounded, then the chiefs, the heads of the thousands of Israel, are to come to you. 

<sup>5</sup> When a loud note is sounded, the tents placed on the east side are to go forward. 

<sup>6</sup> At the sound of a second loud note, the tents on the south side are to go forward: the loud note will be the sign to go forward. 

<sup>7</sup> But when all the people are to come together, the horn is to be sounded but not loudly. 

<sup>8</sup> The horns are to be sounded by the sons of Aaron, the priests; this is to be a law for you for ever, from generation to generation. 

<sup>9</sup> And if you go to war in your land against any who do you wrong, then let the loud note of the horn be sounded; and the Lord your God will keep you in mind and give you salvation from those who are against you. 

<sup>10</sup> And on days of joy and on your regular feasts and on the first day of every month, let the horns be sounded over your burned offerings and your peace-offerings; and they will put the Lord in mind of you: I am the Lord your God. 

<sup>11</sup> Now in the second year, on the twentieth day of the second month, the cloud was taken up from over the Tent of witness. 

<sup>12</sup> And the children of Israel went on their journey out of the waste land of Sinai; and the cloud came to rest in the waste land of Paran. 

<sup>13</sup> They went forward for the first time on their journey as the Lord had given orders by the hand of Moses. 

<sup>14</sup> First the flag of the children of Judah went forward with their armies: and at the head of his army was Nahshon, the son of Amminadab. 

<sup>15</sup> And at the head of the army of the children of Issachar was Nethanel, the son of Zuar. 

<sup>16</sup> And at the head of the army of the children of Zebulun was Eliab, the son of Helon. 

<sup>17</sup> Then the House was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who were responsible for moving the House, went forward. 

<sup>18</sup> Then the flag of the children of Reuben went forward with their armies: and at the head of his army was Elizur, the son of Shedeur. 

<sup>19</sup> And at the head of the army of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai. 

<sup>20</sup> At the head of the army of the children of Gad was Eliasaph, the son of Reuel. 

<sup>21</sup> Then the Kohathites went forward with the holy place; the others put up the House ready for their coming. 

<sup>22</sup> Then the flag of the children of Ephraim went forward with their armies: and at the head of his army was Elishama, the son of Ammihud. 

<sup>23</sup> At the head of the army of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur. 

<sup>24</sup> At the head of the army of the children of Benjamin was Abidan, the son of Gideoni. 

<sup>25</sup> And the flag of the children of Dan, whose tents were moved last of all, went forward with their armies: and at the head of his army was Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai. 

<sup>26</sup> At the head of the army of the children of Asher was Pagiel, the son of Ochran. 

<sup>27</sup> And at the head of the army of the children of Naphtali was Ahira, the son of Enan. 

<sup>28</sup> This was the order in which the children of Israel were journeying by armies; so they went forward. 

<sup>29</sup> Then Moses said to Hobab, the son of his father-in-law Reuel the Midianite, We are journeying to that place of which the Lord has said, I will give it to you: so come with us, and it will be for your profit: for the Lord has good things in store for Israel. 

<sup>30</sup> But he said, I will not go with you, I will go back to the land of my birth and to my relations. 

<sup>31</sup> And he said, Do not go from us; for you will be eyes for us, guiding us to the right places in the waste land to put up our tents. 

<sup>32</sup> And if you come with us, we will give you a part in whatever good the Lord does for us. 

<sup>33</sup> So they went forward three days' journey from the mountain of the Lord; and the ark of the Lord's agreement went three days' journey before them, looking for a resting-place for them; 

<sup>34</sup> And by day the cloud of the Lord went over them, when they went forward from the place where they had put up their tents. 

<sup>35</sup> And when the ark went forward Moses said, Come up, O Lord, and let the armies of those who are against you be broken, and let your haters go in flight before you. 

<sup>36</sup> And when it came to rest, he said, Take rest, O Lord, and give a blessing to the families of Israel.
