# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Give ear to the word of the Lord, O children of Israel; for the Lord has a cause against the people of this land, because there is no good faith in it, and no mercy and no knowledge of God in the land. 

<sup>2</sup> There is cursing and broken faith, violent death and attacks on property, men are untrue in married life, houses are broken into, and there is blood touching blood. 

<sup>3</sup> Because of this the land will be dry, and everyone living in it will be wasted away, with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven; even the fishes of the sea will be taken away. 

<sup>4</sup> Let no man go to law or make protests, for your people are like those who go to law with a priest. 

<sup>5</sup> You will not be able to keep on your feet by day, and by night the prophet will be falling down with you, and I will give your mother to destruction. 

<sup>6</sup> Destruction has overtaken my people because they have no knowledge; because you have given up knowledge, I will give you up, so that you will be no priest to me, because you have not kept in mind the law of your God, I will not keep your children in my memory. 

<sup>7</sup> Even while they were increasing in number they were sinning against me; I will let their glory be changed into shame. 

<sup>8</sup> The sin of my people is like food to them; and their desire is for their wrongdoing. 

<sup>9</sup> And the priest will be like the people; I will give them punishment for their evil ways, and the reward of their acts. 

<sup>10</sup> They will have food, but they will not be full; they will be false to me, but they will not be increased, because they no longer give thought to the Lord. 

<sup>11</sup> Loose ways and new wine take away wisdom. 

<sup>12</sup> My people get knowledge from their tree, and their rod gives them news; for a false spirit is the cause of their wandering, and they have been false to their God. 

<sup>13</sup> They make offerings on the tops of mountains, burning perfumes in high places, under trees of every sort, because their shade is good: and so your daughters are given up to loose ways and your brides are false to their husbands. 

<sup>14</sup> I will not give punishment to your daughters or your brides for their evil behaviour; for they make themselves separate with loose women, and make offerings with those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods: the people who have no wisdom will be sent away. 

<sup>15</sup> Do not you, O Israel, come into error; do not you, O Judah, come to Gilgal, or go up to Beth-aven, or take an oath, By the living Lord. 

<sup>16</sup> For Israel is uncontrolled, like a cow which may not be controlled; now will the Lord give them food like a lamb in a wide place. 

<sup>17</sup> Ephraim is joined to false gods; let him be. 

<sup>18</sup> Their drink has become bitter; they are completely false; her rulers take pleasure in shame. 

<sup>19</sup> They are folded in the skirts of the wind; they will be shamed because of their offerings.
