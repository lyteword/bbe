# Psalm 27

<sup>1</sup> Of David. The Lord is my light and my salvation; who is then a cause of fear to me? the Lord is the strength of my life; who is a danger to me? 

<sup>2</sup> When evil-doers, even my haters, came on me to put an end to me, they were broken and put to shame. 

<sup>3</sup> Even if an army came against me with its tents, my heart would have no fear: if war was made on me, my faith would not be moved. 

<sup>4</sup> One prayer have I made to the Lord, and this is my heart's desire; that I may have a place in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, looking on his glory, and getting wisdom in his Temple. 

<sup>5</sup> For in the time of trouble he will keep me safe in his tent: in the secret place of his tent he will keep me from men's eyes; high on a rock he will put me. 

<sup>6</sup> And now my head will be lifted up higher than my haters who are round me: because of this I will make offerings of joy in his tent; I will make a song, truly I will make a song of praise to the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> O Lord, let the voice of my cry come to your ears: have mercy on me, and give me an answer. 

<sup>8</sup> When you said, Make search for my face, my heart said to you, For your face will I make my search. 

<sup>9</sup> Let not your face be covered from me; do not put away your servant in wrath; you have been my help: do not give me up or take your support from me, O God of my salvation. 

<sup>10</sup> When my father and my mother are turned away from me, then the Lord will be my support. 

<sup>11</sup> Make your way clear to me, O Lord, guiding me by the right way, because of my haters. 

<sup>12</sup> Do not give me into their hands, because false witnesses have come out against me, and men breathing destruction. 

<sup>13</sup> I had almost given up my hope of seeing the blessing of the Lord in the land of the living. 

<sup>14</sup> Let your hope be in the Lord: take heart and be strong; yes, let your hope be in the Lord.
