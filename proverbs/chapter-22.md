# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> A good name is more to be desired than great wealth, and to be respected is better than silver and gold. 

<sup>2</sup> The man of wealth and the poor man come face to face: the Lord is the maker of them all. 

<sup>3</sup> The sharp man sees the evil and takes cover: the simple go straight on and get into trouble. 

<sup>4</sup> The reward of a gentle spirit and the fear of the Lord is wealth and honour and life. 

<sup>5</sup> Thorns and nets are in the way of the twisted: he who keeps watch over his soul will be far from them. 

<sup>6</sup> If a child is trained up in the right way, even when he is old he will not be turned away from it. 

<sup>7</sup> The man of wealth has rule over the poor, and he who gets into debt is a servant to his creditor. 

<sup>8</sup> By planting the seed of evil a man will get in the grain of sorrow, and the rod of his wrath will be broken. 

<sup>9</sup> He who is kind will have a blessing, for he gives of his bread to the poor. 

<sup>10</sup> Send away the man of pride, and argument will go out; truly fighting and shame will come to an end. 

<sup>11</sup> He whose heart is clean is dear to the Lord; for the grace of his lips the king will be his friend. 

<sup>12</sup> The eyes of the Lord keep knowledge, but by him the acts of the false man will be overturned. 

<sup>13</sup> The hater of work says, There is a lion outside: I will be put to death in the streets. 

<sup>14</sup> The mouth of strange women is a deep hole: he with whom the Lord is angry will go down into it. 

<sup>15</sup> Foolish ways are deep-seated in the heart of a child, but the rod of punishment will send them far from him. 

<sup>16</sup> He who is cruel to the poor for the purpose of increasing his profit, and he who gives to the man of wealth, will only come to be in need. 

<sup>17</sup> Let your ear be bent down for hearing my words, and let your heart give thought to knowledge. 

<sup>18</sup> For it is a delight to keep them in your heart, to have them ready on your lips. 

<sup>19</sup> So that your faith may be in the Lord, I have made them clear to you this day, even to you. 

<sup>20</sup> Have I not put in writing for you thirty sayings, with wise suggestions and knowledge, 

<sup>21</sup> To make you see how certain are true words, so that you may give a true answer to those who put questions to you? 

<sup>22</sup> Do not take away the property of the poor man because he is poor, or be cruel to the crushed ones when they come before the judge: 

<sup>23</sup> For the Lord will give support to their cause, and take the life of those who take their goods. 

<sup>24</sup> Do not be friends with a man who is given to wrath; do not go in the company of an angry man: 

<sup>25</sup> For fear of learning his ways and making a net ready for your soul. 

<sup>26</sup> Be not one of those who give their hands in an agreement, or of those who make themselves responsible for debts: 

<sup>27</sup> If you have nothing with which to make payment, he will take away your bed from under you. 

<sup>28</sup> Let not the old landmark be moved which your fathers have put in place. 

<sup>29</sup> Have you seen a man who is expert in his business? he will take his place before kings; his place will not be among low persons.
