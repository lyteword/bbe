# Psalm 51

To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David. When Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.

**¹** Have pity on me, O God, in your mercy; out of a full heart, take away my sin.

**²** Let all my wrongdoing be washed away, and make me clean from evil.

**³** For I am conscious of my error; my sin is ever before me.

**⁴** Against you, you only, have I done wrong, working that which is evil in your eyes; so that your words may be seen to be right, and you may be clear when you are judging.

**⁵** Truly, I was formed in evil, and in sin did my mother give me birth.

**⁶** Your desire is for what is true in the inner parts: in the secrets of my soul you will give me knowledge of wisdom.

**⁷** Make me free from sin with hyssop: let me be washed whiter than snow.

**⁸** Make me full of joy and rapture; so that the bones which have been broken may be glad.

**⁹** Let your face be turned from my wrongdoing, and take away all my sins.

**¹⁰** Make a clean heart in me, O God; give me a right spirit again.

**¹¹** Do not put me away from before you, or take your holy spirit from me.

**¹²** Give me back the joy of your salvation; let a free spirit be my support.

**¹³** Then will I make your ways clear to wrongdoers; and sinners will be turned to you.

**¹⁴** Be my saviour from violent death, O God, the God of my salvation; and my tongue will give praise to your righteousness.

**¹⁵** O Lord, let my lips be open, so that my mouth may make clear your praise.

**¹⁶** You have no desire for an offering or I would give it; you have no delight in burned offerings.

**¹⁷** The offerings of God are a broken spirit; a broken and sorrowing heart, O God, you will not put from you.

**¹⁸** Do good to Zion in your good pleasure, building up the walls of Jerusalem.

**¹⁹** Then you will have delight in the offerings of righteousness, in burned offerings and offerings of beasts; then they will make offerings of oxen on your altar.
