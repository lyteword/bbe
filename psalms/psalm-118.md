# Psalm 118

<sup>1</sup> O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel now say, that his mercy is unchanging for ever. 

<sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy is unchanging for ever. 

<sup>4</sup> Let all worshippers of the Lord now say, that his mercy is unchanging for ever. 

<sup>5</sup> I made my prayer to the Lord in my trouble: and the Lord gave me an answer, and put me in a wide place. 

<sup>6</sup> The Lord is on my side; I will have no fear: what is man able to do to me? 

<sup>7</sup> The Lord is my great helper: I will see my desire against my haters. 

<sup>8</sup> It is better to have faith in the Lord than to put one's hope in man. 

<sup>9</sup> It is better to have faith in the Lord than to put one's hope in rulers. 

<sup>10</sup> All the nations have come round me; but in the name of the Lord I will have them cut down. 

<sup>11</sup> They are round me, yes, they are all about me; but in the name of the Lord I will have them cut down. 

<sup>12</sup> They are round me like bees; but they are put out like a fire among thorns; for in the name of the Lord I will have them cut down. 

<sup>13</sup> I have been hard pushed by you, so that I might have a fall: but the Lord was my helper. 

<sup>14</sup> The Lord is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> The sound of joy and salvation is in the tents of the upright; the right hand of the Lord does works of power. 

<sup>16</sup> The right hand of the Lord is lifted up; the right hand of the Lord does works of power. 

<sup>17</sup> Life and not death will be my part, and I will give out the story of the works of the Lord. 

<sup>18</sup> The hand of Jah has been hard on me; but he has not given me up to death. 

<sup>19</sup> Let the doors of righteousness be open to me; I will go in and give praise to the Lord. 

<sup>20</sup> This is the door of the Lord's house; the workers of righteousness will go in through it. 

<sup>21</sup> I will give you praise, for you have given me an answer, and have become my salvation. 

<sup>22</sup> The stone which the builders put on one side has become the chief stone of the building. 

<sup>23</sup> This is the Lord's doing; it is a wonder in our eyes. 

<sup>24</sup> This is the day which the Lord has made; we will be full of joy and delight in it. 

<sup>25</sup> Send salvation now, O Lord; Lord, send us your blessing. 

<sup>26</sup> A blessing be on him who comes in the name of the Lord; we give you blessing from the house of the Lord. 

<sup>27</sup> The Lord is God, and he has given us light; let the holy dance be ordered with branches, even up to the horns of the altar. 

<sup>28</sup> You are my God, and I will give you praise; my God, and I will give honour to your name. 

<sup>29</sup> O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.
