# Psalm 115

<sup>1</sup> Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name let glory be given, because of your mercy and your unchanging faith. 

<sup>2</sup> Why may the nations say, Where is now their God? 

<sup>3</sup> But our God is in heaven: he has done whatever was pleasing to him. 

<sup>4</sup> Their images are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 

<sup>5</sup> They have mouths, but no voice; they have eyes, but they see not; 

<sup>6</sup> They have ears, but no hearing; they have noses, but no sense of smell; 

<sup>7</sup> They have hands without feeling, and feet without power of walking; and no sound comes from their throat. 

<sup>8</sup> Those who make them are like them; and so is everyone who puts his faith in them. 

<sup>9</sup> O Israel, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate. 

<sup>10</sup> O house of Aaron, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate. 

<sup>11</sup> You worshippers of the Lord, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate. 

<sup>12</sup> The Lord has kept us in mind and will give us his blessing; he will send blessings on the house of Israel and on the house of Aaron. 

<sup>13</sup> He will send blessings on the worshippers of the Lord, on the small and on the great. 

<sup>14</sup> May the Lord give you and your children still greater increase. 

<sup>15</sup> May you have the blessing of the Lord, who made heaven and earth. 

<sup>16</sup> The heavens are the Lord's; but the earth he has given to the children of men. 

<sup>17</sup> The dead do not give praise to the Lord; or those who go down to the underworld. 

<sup>18</sup> But we will give praise to the Lord now and for ever. Praise be to the Lord.
