# Chapter 16

**¹** The designs of the heart are man's, but the answer of the tongue comes from the Lord.

**²** All a man's ways are clean to himself; but the Lord puts men's spirits into his scales.

**³** Put your works into the hands of the Lord, and your purposes will be made certain.

**⁴** The Lord has made everything for his purpose, even the sinner for the day of evil.

**⁵** Everyone who has pride in his heart is disgusting to the Lord: he will certainly not go free from punishment.

**⁶** By mercy and good faith evil-doing is taken away: and by the fear of the Lord men are turned away from evil.

**⁷** When a man's ways are pleasing to the Lord, he makes even his haters be at peace with him.

**⁸** Better is a little with righteousness, than great wealth with wrongdoing.

**⁹** A man may make designs for his way, but the Lord is the guide of his steps.

**¹⁰** Decision is in the lips of the king: his mouth will not go wrong in judging.

**¹¹** True measures and scales are the Lord's: all the weights of the bag are his work.

**¹²** Evil-doing is disgusting to kings: for the seat of the ruler is based on righteousness.

**¹³** Lips of righteousness are the delight of kings; and he who says what is upright is dear to him.

**¹⁴** The wrath of the king is like those who give news of death, but a wise man will put peace in place of it.

**¹⁵** In the light of the king's face there is life; and his approval is like a cloud of spring rain.

**¹⁶** How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! and to get knowledge is more to be desired than silver.

**¹⁷** The highway of the upright is to be turned away from evil: he who takes care of his way will keep his soul.

**¹⁸** Pride goes before destruction, and a stiff spirit before a fall.

**¹⁹** Better it is to have a gentle spirit with the poor, than to take part in the rewards of war with men of pride.

**²⁰** He who gives attention to the law of right will get good; and whoever puts his faith in the Lord is happy.

**²¹** The wise-hearted will be named men of good sense: and by pleasing words learning is increased.

**²²** Wisdom is a fountain of life to him who has it; but the punishment of the foolish is their foolish behaviour.

**²³** The heart of the wise man is the teacher of his mouth, and gives increased learning to his lips.

**²⁴** Pleasing words are like honey, sweet to the soul and new life to the bones.

**²⁵** There is a way which seems straight before a man, but its end is the ways of death.

**²⁶** The desire of the working man is working for him, for his need of food is driving him on.

**²⁷** A good-for-nothing man is a designer of evil, and in his lips there is a burning fire.

**²⁸** A man of twisted purposes is a cause of fighting everywhere: and he who says evil secretly makes trouble between friends.

**²⁹** A violent man puts desire of evil into his neighbour's mind, and makes him go in a way which is not good.

**³⁰** He whose eyes are shut is a man of twisted purposes, and he who keeps his lips shut tight makes evil come about.

**³¹** The grey head is a crown of glory, if it is seen in the way of righteousness.

**³²** He who is slow to be angry is better than a man of war, and he who has control over his spirit than he who takes a town.

**³³** A thing may be put to the decision of chance, but it comes about through the Lord.
