# Chapter 5

**¹** But about the times and their order, my brothers, there is no need for me to say anything to you.

**²** For you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.

**³** When they say, There is peace and no danger, then sudden destruction will come on them, as birth-pains on a woman with child; and they will not be able to get away from it.

**⁴** But you, my brothers, are not in the dark, for that day to overtake you like a thief:

**⁵** For you are all sons of light and of the day: we are not of the night or of the dark.

**⁶** So then, let us not take our rest as the others do, but let us be self-controlled and awake.

**⁷** For those who are sleeping do so in the night; and those who are the worse for drink are so in the night;

**⁸** But let us, who are of the day, be serious, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and on our heads, the hope of salvation.

**⁹** For God's purpose for us is not wrath, but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

**¹⁰** Who was put to death for us, so that, awake or sleeping, we may have a part in his life.

**¹¹** So then, go on comforting and building up one another, as you have been doing.

**¹²** But we make this request to you, my brothers: give attention to those who are working among you, who are over you in the Lord to keep order among you;

**¹³** And have a high opinion of them in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.

**¹⁴** And our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered, giving comfort to the feeble-hearted, supporting those with little strength, and putting up with much from all.

**¹⁵** Let no one give evil for evil; but ever go after what is good, for one another and for all.

**¹⁶** Have joy at all times.

**¹⁷** Keep on with your prayers.

**¹⁸** In everything give praise: for this is the purpose of God in Christ Jesus for you.

**¹⁹** Do not put out the light of the Spirit;

**²⁰** Do not make little of the words of the prophets;

**²¹** Let all things be tested; keep to what is good;

**²²** Keep from every form of evil.

**²³** And may the God of peace himself make you holy in every way; and may your spirit and soul and body be free from all sin at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

**²⁴** God, by whom you have been marked out in his purpose, is unchanging and will make it complete.

**²⁵** Brothers, keep us in mind in your prayers.

**²⁶** Give all the brothers a holy kiss.

**²⁷** I give orders in the name of the Lord that all the brothers are to be present at the reading of this letter.

**²⁸** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
