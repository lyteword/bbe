# Psalm 41

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David. Happy is the man who gives thought to the poor; the Lord will be his saviour in the time of trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> The Lord will keep him safe, and give him life; the Lord will let him be a blessing on the earth, and will not give him into the hand of his haters. 

<sup>3</sup> The Lord will be his support on his bed of pain: by you will all his grief be turned to strength. 

<sup>4</sup> I said, Lord, have mercy on me; make my soul well, because my faith is in you. 

<sup>5</sup> My haters say evil against me, When will he be dead, and his name come to an end? 

<sup>6</sup> If one comes to see me, deceit is in his heart; he keeps a store of evil, which he makes public in every place. 

<sup>7</sup> All my haters are talking secretly together against me; they are designing my downfall. 

<sup>8</sup> They say, He has an evil disease, which will not let him go: and now that he is down he will not get up again. 

<sup>9</sup> Even my dearest friend, in whom I had faith, who took bread with me, is turned against me. 

<sup>10</sup> But you, O Lord, have mercy on me, lifting me up, so that I may give them their punishment. 

<sup>11</sup> By this I see that you have pleasure in me, because my hater does not overcome me. 

<sup>12</sup> And as for me, you are my support in my righteousness, giving me a place before your face for ever. 

<sup>13</sup> May the Lord God of Israel be praised, through eternal days and for ever. So be it. So be it.
