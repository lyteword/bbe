# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> By a soft answer wrath is turned away, but a bitter word is a cause of angry feelings. 

<sup>2</sup> Knowledge is dropping from the tongue of the wise; but from the mouth of the foolish comes a stream of foolish words. 

<sup>3</sup> The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good. 

<sup>4</sup> A comforting tongue is a tree of life, but a twisted tongue is a crushing of the spirit. 

<sup>5</sup> A foolish man puts no value on his father's training; but he who has respect for teaching has good sense. 

<sup>6</sup> In the house of the upright man there is a great store of wealth; but in the profits of the sinner there is trouble. 

<sup>7</sup> The lips of the wise keep knowledge, but the heart of the foolish man is not right. 

<sup>8</sup> The offering of the evil-doer is disgusting to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright man is his delight. 

<sup>9</sup> The way of the evil-doer is disgusting to the Lord, but he who goes after righteousness is dear to him. 

<sup>10</sup> There is bitter punishment for him who is turned from the way; and death will be the fate of the hater of teaching. 

<sup>11</sup> Before the Lord are the underworld and destruction: how much more, then, the hearts of the children of men! 

<sup>12</sup> The hater of authority has no love for teaching: he will not go to the wise. 

<sup>13</sup> A glad heart makes a shining face, but by the sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. 

<sup>14</sup> The heart of the man of good sense goes in search of knowledge, but foolish things are the food of the unwise. 

<sup>15</sup> All the days of the troubled are evil; but he whose heart is glad has an unending feast. 

<sup>16</sup> Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great wealth together with trouble. 

<sup>17</sup> Better is a simple meal where love is, than a fat ox and hate with it. 

<sup>18</sup> An angry man makes men come to blows, but he who is slow to get angry puts an end to fighting. 

<sup>19</sup> Thorns are round the way of the hater of work; but the road of the hard worker becomes a highway. 

<sup>20</sup> A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish man has no respect for his mother. 

<sup>21</sup> Foolish behaviour is joy to the unwise; but a man of good sense makes his way straight. 

<sup>22</sup> Where there are no wise suggestions, purposes come to nothing; but by a number of wise guides they are made certain. 

<sup>23</sup> A man has joy in the answer of his mouth: and a word at the right time, how good it is! 

<sup>24</sup> Acting wisely is the way of life, guiding a man away from the underworld. 

<sup>25</sup> The house of the man of pride will be uprooted by the Lord, but he will make safe the heritage of the widow. 

<sup>26</sup> Evil designs are disgusting to the Lord, but the words of the clean-hearted are pleasing. 

<sup>27</sup> He whose desires are fixed on profit is a cause of trouble to his family; but he who has no desire for offerings will have life. 

<sup>28</sup> The heart of the upright gives thought to his answer; but from the mouth of the evil-doer comes a stream of evil things. 

<sup>29</sup> The Lord is far from sinners, but his ear is open to the prayer of the upright. 

<sup>30</sup> The light of the eyes is a joy to the heart, and good news makes the bones fat. 

<sup>31</sup> The man whose ear is open to the teaching of life will have his place among the wise. 

<sup>32</sup> He who will not be controlled by training has no respect for his soul, but he who gives ear to teaching will get wisdom. 

<sup>33</sup> The fear of the Lord is the teaching of wisdom; and a low opinion of oneself goes before honour.
