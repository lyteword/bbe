# Psalm 115 

**¹** Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name let glory be given, because of your mercy and your unchanging faith.

**²** Why may the nations say, Where is now their God?

**³** But our God is in heaven: he has done whatever was pleasing to him.

**⁴** Their images are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

**⁵** They have mouths, but no voice; they have eyes, but they see not;

**⁶** They have ears, but no hearing; they have noses, but no sense of smell;

**⁷** They have hands without feeling, and feet without power of walking; and no sound comes from their throat.

**⁸** Those who make them are like them; and so is everyone who puts his faith in them.

**⁹** O Israel, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate.

**¹⁰** O house of Aaron, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate.

**¹¹** You worshippers of the Lord, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate.

**¹²** The Lord has kept us in mind and will give us his blessing; he will send blessings on the house of Israel and on the house of Aaron.

**¹³** He will send blessings on the worshippers of the Lord, on the small and on the great.

**¹⁴** May the Lord give you and your children still greater increase.

**¹⁵** May you have the blessing of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

**¹⁶** The heavens are the Lord's; but the earth he has given to the children of men.

**¹⁷** The dead do not give praise to the Lord; or those who go down to the underworld.

**¹⁸** But we will give praise to the Lord now and for ever. Praise be to the Lord.
