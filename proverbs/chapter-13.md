# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> A wise son is a lover of teaching, but the ears of the haters of authority are shut to sharp words.

<sup>2</sup> A man will get good from the fruit of his lips, but the desire of the false is for violent acts.

<sup>3</sup> He who keeps a watch on his mouth keeps his life; but he whose lips are open wide will have destruction.

<sup>4</sup> The hater of work does not get his desires, but the soul of the hard workers will be made fat.

<sup>5</sup> The upright man is a hater of false words: the evil-doer gets a bad name and is put to shame.

<sup>6</sup> Righteousness keeps safe him whose way is without error, but evil-doers are overturned by sin.

<sup>7</sup> A man may be acting as if he had wealth, but have nothing; another may seem poor, but have great wealth.

<sup>8</sup> A man will give his wealth in exchange for his life; but the poor will not give ear to sharp words.

<sup>9</sup> There is a glad dawn for the upright man, but the light of the sinner will be put out.

<sup>10</sup> The only effect of pride is fighting; but wisdom is with the quiet in spirit.

<sup>11</sup> Wealth quickly got will become less; but he who gets a store by the work of his hands will have it increased.

<sup>12</sup> Hope put off is a weariness to the heart; but when what is desired comes, it is a tree of life.

<sup>13</sup> He who makes sport of the word will come to destruction, but the respecter of the law will be rewarded.

<sup>14</sup> The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, turning men away from the nets of death.

<sup>15</sup> Wise behaviour gets approval, but the way of the false is their destruction.

<sup>16</sup> A sharp man does everything with knowledge, but a foolish man makes clear his foolish thoughts.

<sup>17</sup> A man taking false news is a cause of trouble, but he who gives news rightly makes things well.

<sup>18</sup> Need and shame will be the fate of him who is uncontrolled by training; but he who takes note of teaching will be honoured.

<sup>19</sup> To get one's desire is sweet to the soul, but to give up evil is disgusting to the foolish.

<sup>20</sup> Go with wise men and be wise: but he who keeps company with the foolish will be broken.

<sup>21</sup> Evil will overtake sinners, but the upright will be rewarded with good.

<sup>22</sup> The heritage of the good man is handed down to his children's children; and the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the upright man.

<sup>23</sup> There is much food in the ploughed land of the poor; but it is taken away by wrongdoing.

<sup>24</sup> He who keeps back his rod is unkind to his son: the loving father gives punishment with care.

<sup>25</sup> The upright man has food to the full measure of his desire, but there will be no food for the stomach of evil-doers.
