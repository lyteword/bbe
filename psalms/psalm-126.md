# Psalm 126

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. When the Lord made a change in Zion's fate, we were like men in a dream. 

<sup>2</sup> Then our mouths were full of laughing, and our tongues gave a glad cry; they said among the nations, The Lord has done great things for them. 

<sup>3</sup> The Lord has done great things for us; because of which we are glad. 

<sup>4</sup> Let our fate be changed, O Lord, like the streams in the South. 

<sup>5</sup> Those who put in seed with weeping will get in the grain with cries of joy. 

<sup>6</sup> Though a man may go out weeping, taking his vessel of seed with him; he will come again in joy, with the corded stems of grain in his arms.
