# Song Of Solomon 5 

**¹** I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; to take my myrrh with my spice; my wax with my honey; my wine with my milk. Take meat, O friends; take wine, yes, be overcome with love.

**²** I am sleeping, but my heart is awake; it is the sound of my loved one at the door, saying, Be open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my very beautiful one; my head is wet with dew, and my hair with the drops of the night.

**³** I have put off my coat; how may I put it on? My feet are washed; how may I make them unclean?

**⁴** My loved one put his hand on the door, and my heart was moved for him.

**⁵** I got up to let my loved one in; and my hands were dropping with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the lock of the door.

**⁶** I made the door open to my loved one; but my loved one had taken himself away, and was gone, my soul was feeble when his back was turned on me; I went after him, but I did not come near him; I said his name, but he gave me no answer.

**⁷** The keepers who go about the town overtook me; they gave me blows and wounds; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.

**⁸** I say to you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you see my loved one, what will you say to him? That I am overcome with love.

**⁹** What is your loved one more than another, O fairest among women? What is your loved one more than another, that you say this to us?

**¹⁰** My loved one is white and red, the chief among ten thousand.

**¹¹** His head is as the most delicate gold; his hair is thick, and black as a raven.

**¹²** His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the water streams, washed with milk, and rightly placed.

**¹³** His face is as beds of spices, giving out perfumes of every sort; his lips like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.

**¹⁴** His hands are as rings of gold ornamented with beryl-stones; his body is as a smooth plate of ivory covered with sapphires.

**¹⁵** His legs are as pillars of stone on a base of delicate gold; his looks are as Lebanon, beautiful as the cedar-tree.

**¹⁶** His mouth is most sweet; yes, he is all beautiful. This is my loved one, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
