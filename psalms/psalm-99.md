# Psalm 99

<sup>1</sup> The Lord is King; let the peoples be in fear: his seat is on the winged ones; let the earth be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> The Lord is great in Zion; he is high over all the nations. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them give praise to your name, for it is great and to be feared; holy is he. 

<sup>4</sup> The king's power is used for righteousness; you give true decisions, judging rightly in the land of Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> Give high honour to the Lord our God, worshipping at his feet; holy is he. 

<sup>6</sup> Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who gave honour to his name; they made prayers to the Lord, and he gave answers to them. 

<sup>7</sup> His voice came to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept his witness, and the law which he gave them. 

<sup>8</sup> You gave them an answer, O Lord our God; you took away their sin, though you gave them punishment for their wrongdoing. 

<sup>9</sup> Give high honour to the Lord our God, worshipping with your faces turned to his holy hill; for the Lord our God is holy.
