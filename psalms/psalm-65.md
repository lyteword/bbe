# Psalm 65

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David. A Song. It is right for you, O God, to have praise in Zion: to you let the offering be made. 

<sup>2</sup> To you, O hearer of prayer, let the words of all flesh come. 

<sup>3</sup> Evils have overcome us: but as for our sins, you will take them away. 

<sup>4</sup> Happy is the man of your selection, to whom you give a resting-place in your house; we will be full of the good things out of your holy place. 

<sup>5</sup> You will give us an answer in righteousness by great acts of power, O God of our salvation; you who are the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of the far-off lands of the sea; 

<sup>6</sup> The God by whose strength the mountains are fixed; who is robed with power: 

<sup>7</sup> Who makes the loud voice of the sea quiet, and puts an end to the sound of its waves. 

<sup>8</sup> Those in the farthest parts of the earth have fear when they see your signs: the outgoings of the morning and evening are glad because of you. 

<sup>9</sup> You have given your blessing to the earth, watering it and making it fertile; the river of God is full of water: and having made it ready, you give men grain. 

<sup>10</sup> You make the ploughed lands full of water; you make smooth the slopes: you make the earth soft with showers, sending your blessing on its growth. 

<sup>11</sup> The year is crowned with the good you give; life-giving rain is dropping from your footsteps, 

<sup>12</sup> Falling on the grass of the waste land: and the little hills are glad on every side. 

<sup>13</sup> The grass-land is thick with flocks; the valleys are full of grain; they give glad cries and songs of joy.
