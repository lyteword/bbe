# Psalm 113

<sup>1</sup> Let the Lord be praised. O you servants of the Lord, give praise to the name of the Lord.

<sup>2</sup> Let blessing be on the name of the Lord, from this time and for ever.

<sup>3</sup> From the coming up of the sun to its going down, the Lord's name is to be praised.

<sup>4</sup> The Lord is high over all nations, and his glory is higher than the heavens.

<sup>5</sup> Who is like the Lord our God, who is seated on high,

<sup>6</sup> Looking down on the heavens, and on the earth?

<sup>7</sup> He takes the poor man out of the dust, lifting him up from his low position;

<sup>8</sup> To give him a place among the rulers, even with the rulers of his people.

<sup>9</sup> He gives the unfertile woman a family, making her a happy mother of children. Give praise to the Lord.
