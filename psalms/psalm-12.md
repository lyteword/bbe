# Psalm 12 

For the chief music-maker on the Sheminith. A Psalm. Of David.

**¹** Send help, Lord, for mercy has come to an end; there is no more faith among the children of men.

**²** Everyone says false words to his neighbour: their tongues are smooth in their talk, and their hearts are full of deceit.

**³** The smooth lips and the tongue of pride will be cut off by the Lord.

**⁴** They have said, With our tongues will we overcome; our lips are ours: who is lord over us?

**⁵** Because of the crushing of the poor and the weeping of those in need, now will I come to his help, says the Lord; I will give him the salvation which he is desiring.

**⁶** The words of the Lord are true words: like silver tested by fire and burned clean seven times.

**⁷** You will keep them, O Lord, you will keep them safe from this generation for ever.

**⁸** The sinners are walking on every side, and evil is honoured among the children of men.
