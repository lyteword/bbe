# Psalm 138

<sup>1</sup> Of David. I will give you praise with all my heart: I will make melody to you before the gods. 

<sup>2</sup> I will give worship before your holy Temple, praising your name for your mercy and for your unchanging faith: for you have made your word greater than all your name. 

<sup>3</sup> When my cry came to your ears you gave me an answer, and made me great with strength in my soul. 

<sup>4</sup> All the kings of the earth will give you praise, O Lord, when the words of your mouth come to their ears. 

<sup>5</sup> They will make songs about the ways of the Lord; for great is the glory of the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> Though the Lord is high, he sees those who are low; and he has knowledge from far off of those who are lifted up. 

<sup>7</sup> Even when trouble is round me, you will give me life; your hand will be stretched out against the wrath of my haters, and your right hand will be my salvation. 

<sup>8</sup> The Lord will make all things complete for me: O Lord, your mercy is eternal; do not give up the works of your hands.
