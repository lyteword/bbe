# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> I who am myself one of the rulers of the church, and a witness of the death of Christ, having my part in the coming glory, send this serious request to the chief men among you: 

<sup>2</sup> Keep watch over the flock of God which is in your care, using your authority, not as forced to do so, but gladly; and not for unclean profit but with a ready mind; 

<sup>3</sup> Not as lords over God's heritage, but making yourselves examples to the flock. 

<sup>4</sup> And at the coming of the chief Keeper of the sheep, you will be given the eternal crown of glory. 

<sup>5</sup> And in the same way, let the younger men be ruled by the older ones. Let all of you put away pride and make yourselves ready to be servants: for God is a hater of pride, but he gives grace to those who make themselves low. 

<sup>6</sup> For this cause make yourselves low under the strong hand of God, so that when the time comes you may be lifted up; 

<sup>7</sup> Putting all your troubles on him, for he takes care of you. 

<sup>8</sup> Be serious and keep watch; the Evil One, who is against you, goes about like a lion with open mouth in search of food; 

<sup>9</sup> Do not give way to him but be strong in your faith, in the knowledge that your brothers who are in the world undergo the same troubles. 

<sup>10</sup> And after you have undergone pain for a little time, the God of all grace who has given you a part in his eternal glory through Christ Jesus, will himself give you strength and support, and make you complete in every good thing; 

<sup>11</sup> His is the power for ever. So be it. 

<sup>12</sup> I have sent you this short letter by Silvanus, a true brother, in my opinion; comforting you and witnessing that this is the true grace of God; keep to it. 

<sup>13</sup> She who is in Babylon, who has a part with you in the purpose of God, sends you her love; and so does my son Mark. 

<sup>14</sup> Give one another the kiss of love. Peace be to you all in Christ.
