# Psalm 40

<sup>1</sup> To the chief music-maker. Of David. A Psalm. When I was waiting quietly for the Lord, his heart was turned to me, and he gave ear to my cry. 

<sup>2</sup> He took me up out of a deep waste place, out of the soft and sticky earth; he put my feet on a rock, and made my steps certain. 

<sup>3</sup> And he put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God; numbers have seen it with fear, and put their faith in the Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> Happy is the man who has faith in the Lord, and does not give honour to the men of pride or to those who are turned away to deceit. 

<sup>5</sup> O Lord my God, great are the wonders which you have done in your thought for us; it is not possible to put them out in order before you; when I would give an account of them, their number is greater than I may say. 

<sup>6</sup> You had no desire for offerings of beasts or fruits of the earth; ears you made for me: for burned offerings and sin offerings you made no request. 

<sup>7</sup> Then I said, See, I come; it is recorded of me in the roll of the book, 

<sup>8</sup> My delight is to do your pleasure, O my God; truly, your law is in my heart. 

<sup>9</sup> I have given news of righteousness in the great meeting; O Lord, you have knowledge that I have not kept back my words. 

<sup>10</sup> Your righteousness has not been folded away in my heart; I have made clear your true word and your salvation; I have not kept secret your mercy or your faith from the great meeting. 

<sup>11</sup> Take not away your gentle mercies from me, O Lord; let your mercy and your faith keep me safe for ever. 

<sup>12</sup> For unnumbered evils are round about me; my sins have overtaken me, so that I am bent down with their weight; they are more than the hairs of my head, my strength is gone because of them. 

<sup>13</sup> Be pleased, O Lord, to take me out of danger; O Lord, come quickly and give me help. 

<sup>14</sup> Let those who go after my soul for its destruction have shame and trouble together; let them be turned back and made foolish who take pleasure in my trouble. 

<sup>15</sup> Let those who say to me, Aha, aha! be surprised because of their shame. 

<sup>16</sup> Let all those who are looking for you be glad and have joy in you; let the lovers of your salvation ever say, May the Lord be great. 

<sup>17</sup> Though I am poor and in need, the Lord has me in mind; you are my help and my saviour; let there be no waiting, O my God.
