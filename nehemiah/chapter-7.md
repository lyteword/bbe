# Nehemiah 7 

**¹** Now when the building of the wall was complete and I had put up the doors, and the door-keepers and the music-makers and the Levites had been given their places,

**²** I made my brother Hanani, and Hananiah, the ruler of the tower, responsible for the government of Jerusalem: for he was a man of good faith, fearing God more than most.

**³** And I said to them, Do not let the doors of Jerusalem be open till the sun is high; and while the watchmen are in their places, let the doors be shut and locked: and let the people of Jerusalem be put on watch, every one in his watch, opposite his house.

**⁴** Now the town was wide and great: but the people in it were only a small number, and the houses had not been put up.

**⁵** And my God put it into my heart to get together the rulers and the chiefs and the people so that they might be listed by families. And I came across a record of the names of those who came up at the first, and in it I saw these words:

**⁶** These are the people of the divisions of the kingdom, among those who had been made prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and taken away by him, who went back to Jerusalem and Judah, every one to his town;

**⁷** Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

**⁶⁰** All the Nethinim and the children of Solomon's servants were three hundred and ninety-two.

**⁶¹** All these were the people who went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but because they had no knowledge of their fathers' families or offspring, it was not certain if they were Israelites:

**⁶²** The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two.

**⁶³** And of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who was married to one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and took their name.

**⁶⁴** They made search for their record among the lists of families, but their names were nowhere to be seen, so they were looked on as unclean and no longer priests.

**⁶⁵** And the Tirshatha said that they were not to have the most holy things for their food, till a priest came to give decision by the Urim and Thummim.

**⁶⁶** The number of all the people together was forty-two thousand, three hundred and sixty;

**⁶⁷** As well as their men-servants and their women-servants, of whom there were seven thousand, three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred and forty-five men and women to make music.

**⁶⁸** They had seven hundred and thirty-six horses, two hundred and forty-five transport beasts;

**⁶⁹** Four hundred and thirty-five camels, six thousand, seven hundred and twenty asses.

**⁷⁰** And some of the heads of families gave money for the work. The Tirshatha gave into the store a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' robes.

**⁷¹** And some of the heads of families gave into the store for the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand, two hundred pounds of silver.

**⁷²** And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and sixty-seven priests' robes.

**⁷³** So the priests and the Levites and the door-keepers and the music-makers and some of the people and the Nethinim, and all Israel, were living in their towns.
