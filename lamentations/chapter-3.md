# Lamentations 3 

**¹** I am the man who has seen trouble by the rod of his wrath.

**²** By him I have been made to go in the dark where there is no light.

**³** Truly against me his hand has been turned again and again all the day.

**⁴** My flesh and my skin have been used up by him and my bones broken.

**⁵** He has put up a wall against me, shutting me in with bitter sorrow.

**⁶** He has kept me in dark places, like those who have been long dead.

**⁷** He has put a wall round me, so that I am not able to go out; he has made great the weight of my chain.

**⁸** Even when I send up a cry for help, he keeps my prayer shut out.

**⁹** He has put up a wall of cut stones about my ways, he has made my roads twisted.

**¹⁰** He is like a bear waiting for me, like a lion in secret places.

**¹¹** By him my ways have been turned on one side and I have been pulled in bits; he has made me waste.

**¹²** With his bow bent, he has made me the mark for his arrows.

**¹³** He has let loose his arrows into the inmost parts of my body.

**¹⁴** I have become the sport of all the peoples; I am their song all the day.

**¹⁵** He has made my life nothing but pain, he has given me the bitter root in full measure.

**¹⁶** By him my teeth have been broken with crushed stones, and I am bent low in the dust.

**¹⁷** My soul is sent far away from peace, I have no more memory of good.

**¹⁸** And I said, My strength is cut off, and my hope from the Lord.

**¹⁹** Keep in mind my trouble and my wandering, the bitter root and the poison.

**²⁰** My soul still keeps the memory of them; and is bent down in me.

**²¹** This I keep in mind, and because of this I have hope.

**²²** It is through the Lord's love that we have not come to destruction, because his mercies have no limit.

**²³** They are new every morning; great is your good faith.

**²⁴** I said to myself, The Lord is my heritage; and because of this I will have hope in him.

**²⁵** The Lord is good to those who are waiting for him, to the soul which is looking for him.

**²⁶** It is good to go on hoping and quietly waiting for the salvation of the Lord.

**²⁷** It is good for a man to undergo the yoke when he is young.

**²⁸** Let him be seated by himself, saying nothing, because he has put it on him.

**²⁹** Let him put his mouth in the dust, if by chance there may be hope.

**³⁰** Let his face be turned to him who gives him blows; let him be full of shame.

**³¹** For the Lord does not give a man up for ever.

**³²** For though he sends grief, still he will have pity in the full measure of his love.

**³³** For he has no pleasure in troubling and causing grief to the children of men.

**³⁴** In a man's crushing under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,

**³⁵** In his turning away the right of a man before the face of the Most High.

**³⁶** In his doing wrong to a man in his cause, the Lord has no pleasure.

**³⁷** Who is able to say a thing, and give effect to it, if it has not been ordered by the Lord?

**³⁸** Do not evil and good come from the mouth of the Most High?

**³⁹** What protest may a living man make, even a man about the punishment of his sin?

**⁴⁰** Let us make search and put our ways to the test, turning again to the Lord;

**⁴¹** Lifting up our hearts with our hands to God in the heavens.

**⁴²** We have done wrong and gone against your law; we have not had your forgiveness.

**⁴³** Covering yourself with wrath you have gone after us, cutting us off without pity;

**⁴⁴** Covering yourself with a cloud, so that prayer may not get through.

**⁴⁵** You have made us like waste and that for which there is no use, among the peoples.

**⁴⁶** The mouths of all our haters are open wide against us.

**⁴⁷** Fear and deep waters have come on us, wasting and destruction.

**⁴⁸** Rivers of water are running down from my eyes, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

**⁴⁹** My eyes are streaming without stopping, they have no rest,

**⁵⁰** Till the Lord's eye is turned on me, till he sees my trouble from heaven.

**⁵¹** The Lord is unkind to my soul, more than all the daughters of my town.

**⁵²** They who are against me without cause have gone hard after me as if I was a bird;

**⁵³** They have put an end to my life in the prison, stoning me with stones.

**⁵⁴** Waters were flowing over my head; I said, I am cut off.

**⁵⁵** I was making prayer to your name, O Lord, out of the lowest prison.

**⁵⁶** My voice came to you; let not your ear be shut to my breathing, to my cry.

**⁵⁷** You came near in the day when I made my prayer to you: you said, Have no fear.

**⁵⁸** O Lord, you have taken up the cause of my soul, you have made my life safe.

**⁵⁹** O Lord, you have seen my wrong; be judge in my cause.

**⁶⁰** You have seen all the evil rewards they have sent on me, and all their designs against me.

**⁶¹** Their bitter words have come to your ears, O Lord, and all their designs against me;

**⁶²** The lips of those who came up against me, and their thoughts against me all the day.

**⁶³** Take note of them when they are seated, and when they get up; I am their song.

**⁶⁴** You will give them their reward, O Lord, answering to the work of their hands.

**⁶⁵** You will let their hearts be covered over with your curse on them.

**⁶⁶** You will go after them in wrath, and put an end to them from under the heavens of the Lord.
