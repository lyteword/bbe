# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Then, opening his mouth, and cursing the day of his birth,

<sup>2</sup> Job made answer and said,

<sup>3</sup> Let destruction take the day of my birth, and the night on which it was said, A man child has come into the world.

<sup>4</sup> That day — let it be dark; let not God take note of it from on high, and let not the light be shining on it;

<sup>5</sup> Let the dark and the black night take it for themselves; let it be covered with a cloud; let the dark shades of day send fear on it.

<sup>6</sup> That night — let the thick dark take it; let it not have joy among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.

<sup>7</sup> As for that night, let it have no fruit; let no voice of joy be sounded in it;

<sup>8</sup> Let it be cursed by those who put a curse on the day; who are ready to make Leviathan awake.

<sup>9</sup> Let its morning stars be dark; let it be looking for light, but may it not have any; let it not see the eyes of the dawn.

<sup>10</sup> Because it did not keep the doors of my mother's body shut, so that trouble might be veiled from my eyes.

<sup>11</sup> Why did death not take me when I came out of my mother's body, why did I not, when I came out, give up my last breath?

<sup>12</sup> Why did the knees take me, or why the breasts that they might give me milk?

<sup>13</sup> For then I might have gone to my rest in quiet, and in sleep have been in peace,

<sup>14</sup> With kings and the wise ones of the earth, who put up great houses for themselves;

<sup>15</sup> Or with rulers who had gold, and whose houses were full of silver;

<sup>16</sup> Or as a child dead at birth I might never have come into existence; like young children who have not seen the light.

<sup>17</sup> There the passions of the evil are over, and those whose strength has come to an end have rest.

<sup>18</sup> There the prisoners are at peace together; the voice of the overseer comes not again to their ears.

<sup>19</sup> The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master.

<sup>20</sup> Why does he give light to him who is in trouble, and life to the bitter in soul;

<sup>21</sup> To those whose desire is for death, but it comes not; who are searching for it more than for secret wealth;

<sup>22</sup> Who are glad with great joy, and full of delight when they come to their last resting-place;

<sup>23</sup> To a man whose way is veiled, and who is shut in by God?

<sup>24</sup> In place of my food I have grief, and cries of sorrow come from me like water.

<sup>25</sup> For I have a fear and it comes on me, and my heart is greatly troubled.

<sup>26</sup> I have no peace, no quiet, and no rest; nothing but pain comes on me.
