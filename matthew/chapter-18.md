# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 

<sup>2</sup> And he took a little child, and put him in the middle of them, 

<sup>3</sup> And said, Truly, I say to you, If you do not have a change of heart and become like little children, you will not go into the kingdom of heaven. 

<sup>4</sup> Whoever, then, will make himself as low as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 

<sup>5</sup> And whoever gives honour to one such little child in my name, gives honour to me: 

<sup>6</sup> But whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a great stone fixed to his neck, and to come to his end in the deep sea. 

<sup>7</sup> A curse is on the earth because of trouble! for it is necessary for trouble to come; but unhappy is that man through whom the trouble comes. 

<sup>8</sup> And if your hand or your foot is a cause of trouble, let it be cut off and put it away from you: it is better for you to go into life with the loss of a hand or a foot than, having two hands or two feet, to go into the eternal fire. 

<sup>9</sup> And if your eye is a cause of trouble to you, take it out, and put it away from you: it is better for you to go into life with one eye than, having two eyes, to go into the hell of fire. 

<sup>10</sup> Let it not seem to you that one of these little ones is of no value; for I say to you that in heaven their angels see at all times the face of my Father in heaven.
