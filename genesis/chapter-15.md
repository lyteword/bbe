# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Have no fear, Abram: I will keep you safe, and great will be your reward. 

<sup>2</sup> And Abram said, What will you give me? for I have no child and this Eliezer of Damascus will have all my wealth after me. 

<sup>3</sup> And Abram said, You have given me no child, and a servant in my house will get the heritage. 

<sup>4</sup> Then said the Lord, This man will not get the heritage, but a son of your body will have your property after you. 

<sup>5</sup> And he took him out into the open air, and said to him, Let your eyes be lifted to heaven, and see if the stars may be numbered; even so will your seed be. 

<sup>6</sup> And he had faith in the Lord, and it was put to his account as righteousness. 

<sup>7</sup> And he said to him, I am the Lord, who took you from Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land for your heritage. 

<sup>8</sup> And he said, O Lord God, how may I be certain that it will be mine? 

<sup>9</sup> And he said, Take a young cow of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a sheep of three years old, and a dove and a young pigeon. 

<sup>10</sup> All these he took, cutting them in two and putting one half opposite the other, but not cutting the birds in two. 

<sup>11</sup> And evil birds came down on the bodies, but Abram sent them away. 

<sup>12</sup> Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep came on Abram, and a dark cloud of fear. 

<sup>13</sup> And he said to Abram, Truly, your seed will be living in a land which is not theirs, as servants to a people who will be cruel to them for four hundred years; 

<sup>14</sup> But I will be the judge of that nation whose servants they are, and they will come out from among them with great wealth. 

<sup>15</sup> As for you, you will go to your fathers in peace; at the end of a long life you will be put in your last resting-place. 

<sup>16</sup> And in the fourth generation they will come back here; for at present the sin of the Amorite is not full. 

<sup>17</sup> Then when the sun went down and it was dark, he saw a smoking fire and a flaming light which went between the parts of the bodies. 

<sup>18</sup> In that day the Lord made an agreement with Abram, and said, To your seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates: 

<sup>19</sup> The Kenite, the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, 

<sup>20</sup> And the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, 

<sup>21</sup> And the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.
