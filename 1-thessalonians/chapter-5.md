# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> But about the times and their order, my brothers, there is no need for me to say anything to you.

<sup>2</sup> For you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.

<sup>3</sup> When they say, There is peace and no danger, then sudden destruction will come on them, as birth-pains on a woman with child; and they will not be able to get away from it.

<sup>4</sup> But you, my brothers, are not in the dark, for that day to overtake you like a thief:

<sup>5</sup> For you are all sons of light and of the day: we are not of the night or of the dark.

<sup>6</sup> So then, let us not take our rest as the others do, but let us be self-controlled and awake.

<sup>7</sup> For those who are sleeping do so in the night; and those who are the worse for drink are so in the night;

<sup>8</sup> But let us, who are of the day, be serious, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and on our heads, the hope of salvation.

<sup>9</sup> For God's purpose for us is not wrath, but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

<sup>10</sup> Who was put to death for us, so that, awake or sleeping, we may have a part in his life.

<sup>11</sup> So then, go on comforting and building up one another, as you have been doing.

<sup>12</sup> But we make this request to you, my brothers: give attention to those who are working among you, who are over you in the Lord to keep order among you;

<sup>13</sup> And have a high opinion of them in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.

<sup>14</sup> And our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered, giving comfort to the feeble-hearted, supporting those with little strength, and putting up with much from all.

<sup>15</sup> Let no one give evil for evil; but ever go after what is good, for one another and for all.

<sup>16</sup> Have joy at all times.

<sup>17</sup> Keep on with your prayers.

<sup>18</sup> In everything give praise: for this is the purpose of God in Christ Jesus for you.

<sup>19</sup> Do not put out the light of the Spirit;

<sup>20</sup> Do not make little of the words of the prophets;

<sup>21</sup> Let all things be tested; keep to what is good;

<sup>22</sup> Keep from every form of evil.

<sup>23</sup> And may the God of peace himself make you holy in every way; and may your spirit and soul and body be free from all sin at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<sup>24</sup> God, by whom you have been marked out in his purpose, is unchanging and will make it complete.

<sup>25</sup> Brothers, keep us in mind in your prayers.

<sup>26</sup> Give all the brothers a holy kiss.

<sup>27</sup> I give orders in the name of the Lord that all the brothers are to be present at the reading of this letter.

<sup>28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
