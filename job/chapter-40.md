# Job 40 

**¹** ...

**²** Will he who is protesting give teaching to the Ruler of all? Let him who has arguments to put forward against God give an answer.

**³** And Job said in answer to the Lord,

**⁴** Truly, I am of no value; what answer may I give to you? I will put my hand on my mouth.

**⁵** I have said once, and even twice, what was in my mind, but I will not do so again.

**⁶** Then the Lord made answer to Job out of the storm-wind, and said,

**⁷** Get your strength together like a man of war: I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers.

**⁸** Will you even make my right of no value? will you say that I am wrong in order to make clear that you are right?

**⁹** Have you an arm like God? have you a voice of thunder like his?

**¹⁰** Put on the ornaments of your pride; be clothed with glory and power:

**¹¹** Let your wrath be overflowing; let your eyes see all the sons of pride, and make them low.

**¹²** Send destruction on all who are lifted up, pulling down the sinners from their places.

**¹³** Let them be covered together in the dust; let their faces be dark in the secret place of the underworld.

**¹⁴** Then I will give praise to you, saying that your right hand is able to give you salvation.

**¹⁵** See now the Great Beast, whom I made, even as I made you; he takes grass for food, like the ox.

**¹⁶** His strength is in his body, and his force in the muscles of his stomach.

**¹⁷** His tail is curving like a cedar; the muscles of his legs are joined together.

**¹⁸** His bones are pipes of brass, his legs are like rods of iron.

**¹⁹** He is the chief of the ways of God, made by him for his pleasure.

**²⁰** He takes the produce of the mountains, where all the beasts of the field are at play.

**²¹** He takes his rest under the trees of the river, and in the pool, under the shade of the water-plants.

**²²** He is covered by the branches of the trees; the grasses of the stream are round him.

**²³** Truly, if the river is overflowing, it gives him no cause for fear; he has no sense of danger, even if Jordan is rushing against his mouth.

**²⁴** Will anyone take him when he is on the watch, or put metal teeth through his nose?
