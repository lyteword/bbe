# Psalm 25

<sup>1</sup> Of David. To you, O Lord, my soul is lifted up. 

<sup>2</sup> O my God, I have put my faith in you, let me not be shamed; let not my haters be glorying over me. 

<sup>3</sup> Let no servant of yours be put to shame; may those be shamed who are false without cause. 

<sup>4</sup> Make your steps clear to me, O Lord; give me knowledge of your ways. 

<sup>5</sup> Be my guide and teacher in the true way; for you are the God of my salvation; I am waiting for your word all the day. 

<sup>6</sup> O Lord, keep in mind your pity and your mercies; for they have been from the earliest times. 

<sup>7</sup> Do not keep in mind my sins when I was young, or my wrongdoing: let your memory of me be full of mercy, O Lord, because of your righteousness. 

<sup>8</sup> Good and upright is the Lord: so he will be the teacher of sinners in the way. 

<sup>9</sup> He will be an upright guide to the poor in spirit: he will make his way clear to them. 

<sup>10</sup> All the ways of the Lord are mercy and good faith for those who keep his agreement and his witness. 

<sup>11</sup> Because of your name, O Lord, let me have forgiveness for my sin, which is very great. 

<sup>12</sup> If a man has the fear of the Lord, the Lord will be his teacher in the way of his pleasure. 

<sup>13</sup> His soul will be full of good things, and his seed will have the earth for its heritage. 

<sup>14</sup> The secret of the Lord is with those in whose hearts is the fear of him; he will make his agreement clear to them. 

<sup>15</sup> My eyes are turned to the Lord at all times; for he will take my feet out of the net. 

<sup>16</sup> Be turned to me, and have mercy on me; for I am troubled and have no helper. 

<sup>17</sup> The troubles of my heart are increased: O take me out of my sorrows. 

<sup>18</sup> Give thought to my grief and my pain; and take away all my sins. 

<sup>19</sup> See how those who are against me are increased, for bitter is their hate of me. 

<sup>20</sup> O keep my soul, and take me out of danger: let me not be shamed, for I have put my faith in you. 

<sup>21</sup> For my clean and upright ways keep me safe, because my hope is in you. 

<sup>22</sup> Give Israel salvation, O God, out of all his troubles.
