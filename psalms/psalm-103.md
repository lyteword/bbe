# Psalm 103

<sup>1</sup> Of David. Give praise to the Lord, O my soul; let everything in me give praise to his holy name. 

<sup>2</sup> Give praise to the Lord, O my soul; let not all his blessings go from your memory. 

<sup>3</sup> He has forgiveness for all your sins; he takes away all your diseases; 

<sup>4</sup> He keeps back your life from destruction, crowning you with mercy and grace. 

<sup>5</sup> He makes your mouth full of good things, so that your strength is made new again like the eagle's. 

<sup>6</sup> The Lord gives decisions in righteousness for all who are in trouble. 

<sup>7</sup> He gave knowledge of his way to Moses, and made his acts clear to the children of Israel. 

<sup>8</sup> The Lord is kind and full of pity, not quickly made angry, but ever ready to have mercy. 

<sup>9</sup> His feeling will no longer be bitter; he will not keep his wrath for ever. 

<sup>10</sup> He has not given us the punishment for our sins, or the reward of our wrongdoing. 

<sup>11</sup> For as the heaven is high over the earth, so great is his mercy to his worshippers. 

<sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west, so far has he put our sins from us. 

<sup>13</sup> As a father has pity on his children, so the Lord has pity on his worshippers. 

<sup>14</sup> For he has knowledge of our feeble frame; he sees that we are only dust. 

<sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are as grass: his beautiful growth is like the flower of the field. 

<sup>16</sup> The wind goes over it and it is gone; and its place sees it no longer. 

<sup>17</sup> But the mercy of the Lord is eternal for his worshippers, and their children's children will see his righteousness; 

<sup>18</sup> If they keep his agreement, and have his laws in mind to do them. 

<sup>19</sup> The Lord has made ready his high seat in the heavens; his kingdom is ruling over all. 

<sup>20</sup> Give praise to the Lord, you his angels, who are great in strength, doing his orders, and waiting for his voice. 

<sup>21</sup> Give praise to the Lord, all you his armies; and you his servants who do his pleasure. 

<sup>22</sup> Give praise to the Lord, all his works, in all places under his rule: give praise to the Lord, O my soul.
