# Psalm 87

Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm. A Song.

<sup>1</sup> This house is resting on the holy mountain.

<sup>2</sup> The Lord has more love for the doors of Zion than for all the tents of Jacob.

<sup>3</sup> Noble things are said of you, O town of God. (Selah.)

<sup>4</sup> Rahab and Babylon will be named among those who have knowledge of me; see, Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man had his birth there.

<sup>5</sup> And of Zion it will be said, This or that man had his birth there; and the Most High will make her strong.

<sup>6</sup> The Lord will keep in mind, when he is writing the records of the people, that this man had his birth there. (Selah.)

<sup>7</sup> The players on instruments will be there, and the dancers will say, All my springs are in you.
