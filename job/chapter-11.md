# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Are all these words to go unanswered? and is a man seen to be right because he is full of talk? 

<sup>3</sup> Are your words of pride to make men keep quiet? and are you to make sport, with no one to put you to shame? 

<sup>4</sup> You may say, My way is clean, and I am free from sin in your eyes. 

<sup>5</sup> But if only God would take up the word, opening his lips in argument with you; 

<sup>6</sup> And would make clear to you the secrets of wisdom, and the wonders of his purpose! 

<sup>7</sup> Are you able to take God's measure, to make discovery of the limits of the Ruler of all? 

<sup>8</sup> They are higher than heaven; what is there for you to do? deeper than the underworld, and outside your knowledge; 

<sup>9</sup> Longer in measure than the earth, and wider than the sea. 

<sup>10</sup> If he goes on his way, shutting a man up and putting him to death, who may make him go back from his purpose? 

<sup>11</sup> For in his eyes men are as nothing; he sees evil and takes note of it. 

<sup>12</sup> And so a hollow-minded man will get wisdom, when a young ass of the field gets teaching. 

<sup>13</sup> But if you put your heart right, stretching out your hands to him; 

<sup>14</sup> If you put far away the evil of your hands, and let no wrongdoing have a place in your tent; 

<sup>15</sup> Then truly your face will be lifted up, with no mark of sin, and you will be fixed in your place without fear: 

<sup>16</sup> For your sorrow will go from your memory, like waters flowing away: 

<sup>17</sup> And your life will be brighter than day; though it is dark, it will become like the morning. 

<sup>18</sup> And you will be safe because there is hope; after looking round, you will take your rest in quiet; 

<sup>19</sup> Sleeping with no fear of danger; and men will be desiring to have grace in your eyes; 

<sup>20</sup> But the eyes of the evil-doers will be wasting away; their way of flight is gone, and their only hope is the taking of their last breath.
