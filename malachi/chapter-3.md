# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> See, I am sending my servant, and he will make ready the way before me; and the Lord, whom you are looking for, will suddenly come to his Temple; and the angel of the agreement, in whom you have delight, see, he is coming, says the Lord of armies. 

<sup>2</sup> But by whom may the day of his coming be faced? and who may keep his place when he is seen? for he is like the metal-tester's fire and the cleaner's soap. 

<sup>3</sup> He will take his seat, testing and cleaning the sons of Levi, burning away the evil from them as from gold and silver; so that they may make offerings to the Lord in righteousness. 

<sup>4</sup> Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord, as in days gone by, and as in past years. 

<sup>5</sup> And I will come near to you for judging; I will quickly be a witness against the wonder-workers, against those who have been untrue in married life, against those who take false oaths; against those who keep back from the servant his payment, and who are hard on the widow and the child without a father, who do not give his rights to the man from a strange country, and have no fear of me, says the Lord of armies. 

<sup>6</sup> For I am the Lord, I am unchanged; and so you, O sons of Jacob, have not been cut off. 

<sup>7</sup> From the days of your fathers you have been turned away from my rules and have not kept them. Come back to me, and I will come back to you, says the Lord of armies. But you say, How are we to come back? 

<sup>8</sup> Will a man keep back from God what is right? But you have kept back what is mine. But you say, What have we kept back from you? Tenths and offerings. 

<sup>9</sup> You are cursed with a curse; for you have kept back from me what is mine, even all this nation. 

<sup>10</sup> Let your tenths come into the store-house so that there may be food in my house, and put me to the test by doing so, says the Lord of armies, and see if I do not make the windows of heaven open and send down such a blessing on you that there is no room for it. 

<sup>11</sup> And on your account I will keep back the locusts from wasting the fruits of your land; and the fruit of your vine will not be dropped on the field before its time, says the Lord of armies 

<sup>12</sup> And you will be named happy by all nations: for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of armies. 

<sup>13</sup> Your words have been strong against me, says the Lord. And still you say, What have we said against you? 

<sup>14</sup> You have said, It is no use worshipping God: what profit have we had from keeping his orders, and going in clothing of sorrow before the Lord of armies? 

<sup>15</sup> And now to us the men of pride seem happy; yes, the evil-doers are doing well; they put God to the test and are safe. 

<sup>16</sup> Then those in whom was the fear of the Lord had talk together: and the Lord gave ear, and it was recorded in a book to be kept in mind before him, for those who had the fear of the Lord and gave thought to his name. 

<sup>17</sup> And they will be mine, says the Lord, in the day when I make them my special property; and I will have mercy on them as a man has mercy on his son who is his servant. 

<sup>18</sup> Then you will again see how the upright man is different from the sinner, and the servant of God from him who is not.
