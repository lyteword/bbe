# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> I am the man who has seen trouble by the rod of his wrath. 

<sup>2</sup> By him I have been made to go in the dark where there is no light. 

<sup>3</sup> Truly against me his hand has been turned again and again all the day. 

<sup>4</sup> My flesh and my skin have been used up by him and my bones broken. 

<sup>5</sup> He has put up a wall against me, shutting me in with bitter sorrow. 

<sup>6</sup> He has kept me in dark places, like those who have been long dead. 

<sup>7</sup> He has put a wall round me, so that I am not able to go out; he has made great the weight of my chain. 

<sup>8</sup> Even when I send up a cry for help, he keeps my prayer shut out. 

<sup>9</sup> He has put up a wall of cut stones about my ways, he has made my roads twisted. 

<sup>10</sup> He is like a bear waiting for me, like a lion in secret places. 

<sup>11</sup> By him my ways have been turned on one side and I have been pulled in bits; he has made me waste. 

<sup>12</sup> With his bow bent, he has made me the mark for his arrows. 

<sup>13</sup> He has let loose his arrows into the inmost parts of my body. 

<sup>14</sup> I have become the sport of all the peoples; I am their song all the day. 

<sup>15</sup> He has made my life nothing but pain, he has given me the bitter root in full measure. 

<sup>16</sup> By him my teeth have been broken with crushed stones, and I am bent low in the dust. 

<sup>17</sup> My soul is sent far away from peace, I have no more memory of good. 

<sup>18</sup> And I said, My strength is cut off, and my hope from the Lord. 

<sup>19</sup> Keep in mind my trouble and my wandering, the bitter root and the poison. 

<sup>20</sup> My soul still keeps the memory of them; and is bent down in me. 

<sup>21</sup> This I keep in mind, and because of this I have hope. 

<sup>22</sup> It is through the Lord's love that we have not come to destruction, because his mercies have no limit. 

<sup>23</sup> They are new every morning; great is your good faith. 

<sup>24</sup> I said to myself, The Lord is my heritage; and because of this I will have hope in him. 

<sup>25</sup> The Lord is good to those who are waiting for him, to the soul which is looking for him. 

<sup>26</sup> It is good to go on hoping and quietly waiting for the salvation of the Lord. 

<sup>27</sup> It is good for a man to undergo the yoke when he is young. 

<sup>28</sup> Let him be seated by himself, saying nothing, because he has put it on him. 

<sup>29</sup> Let him put his mouth in the dust, if by chance there may be hope. 

<sup>30</sup> Let his face be turned to him who gives him blows; let him be full of shame. 

<sup>31</sup> For the Lord does not give a man up for ever. 

<sup>32</sup> For though he sends grief, still he will have pity in the full measure of his love. 

<sup>33</sup> For he has no pleasure in troubling and causing grief to the children of men. 

<sup>34</sup> In a man's crushing under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, 

<sup>35</sup> In his turning away the right of a man before the face of the Most High. 

<sup>36</sup> In his doing wrong to a man in his cause, the Lord has no pleasure. 

<sup>37</sup> Who is able to say a thing, and give effect to it, if it has not been ordered by the Lord? 

<sup>38</sup> Do not evil and good come from the mouth of the Most High? 

<sup>39</sup> What protest may a living man make, even a man about the punishment of his sin? 

<sup>40</sup> Let us make search and put our ways to the test, turning again to the Lord; 

<sup>41</sup> Lifting up our hearts with our hands to God in the heavens. 

<sup>42</sup> We have done wrong and gone against your law; we have not had your forgiveness. 

<sup>43</sup> Covering yourself with wrath you have gone after us, cutting us off without pity; 

<sup>44</sup> Covering yourself with a cloud, so that prayer may not get through. 

<sup>45</sup> You have made us like waste and that for which there is no use, among the peoples. 

<sup>46</sup> The mouths of all our haters are open wide against us. 

<sup>47</sup> Fear and deep waters have come on us, wasting and destruction. 

<sup>48</sup> Rivers of water are running down from my eyes, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

<sup>49</sup> My eyes are streaming without stopping, they have no rest, 

<sup>50</sup> Till the Lord's eye is turned on me, till he sees my trouble from heaven. 

<sup>51</sup> The Lord is unkind to my soul, more than all the daughters of my town. 

<sup>52</sup> They who are against me without cause have gone hard after me as if I was a bird; 

<sup>53</sup> They have put an end to my life in the prison, stoning me with stones. 

<sup>54</sup> Waters were flowing over my head; I said, I am cut off. 

<sup>55</sup> I was making prayer to your name, O Lord, out of the lowest prison. 

<sup>56</sup> My voice came to you; let not your ear be shut to my breathing, to my cry. 

<sup>57</sup> You came near in the day when I made my prayer to you: you said, Have no fear. 

<sup>58</sup> O Lord, you have taken up the cause of my soul, you have made my life safe. 

<sup>59</sup> O Lord, you have seen my wrong; be judge in my cause. 

<sup>60</sup> You have seen all the evil rewards they have sent on me, and all their designs against me. 

<sup>61</sup> Their bitter words have come to your ears, O Lord, and all their designs against me; 

<sup>62</sup> The lips of those who came up against me, and their thoughts against me all the day. 

<sup>63</sup> Take note of them when they are seated, and when they get up; I am their song. 

<sup>64</sup> You will give them their reward, O Lord, answering to the work of their hands. 

<sup>65</sup> You will let their hearts be covered over with your curse on them. 

<sup>66</sup> You will go after them in wrath, and put an end to them from under the heavens of the Lord.
