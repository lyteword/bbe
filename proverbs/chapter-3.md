# Proverbs 3 

**¹** My son, keep my teaching in your memory, and my rules in your heart:

**²** For they will give you increase of days, years of life, and peace.

**³** Let not mercy and good faith go from you; let them be hanging round your neck, recorded on your heart;

**⁴** So you will have grace and a good name in the eyes of God and men.

**⁵** Put all your hope in God, not looking to your reason for support.

**⁶** In all your ways give ear to him, and he will make straight your footsteps.

**⁷** Put no high value on your wisdom: let the fear of the Lord be before you, and keep yourself from evil:

**⁸** This will give strength to your flesh, and new life to your bones.

**⁹** Give honour to the Lord with your wealth, and with the first-fruits of all your increase:

**¹⁰** So your store-houses will be full of grain, and your vessels overflowing with new wine.

**¹¹** My son, do not make your heart hard against the Lord's teaching; do not be made angry by his training:

**¹²** For to those who are dear to him the Lord says sharp words, and makes the son in whom he has delight undergo pain.

**¹³** Happy is the man who makes discovery of wisdom, and he who gets knowledge.

**¹⁴** For trading in it is better than trading in silver, and its profit greater than bright gold.

**¹⁵** She is of more value than jewels, and nothing for which you may have a desire is fair in comparison with her.

**¹⁶** Long life is in her right hand, and in her left are wealth and honour.

**¹⁷** Her ways are ways of delight, and all her goings are peace.

**¹⁸** She is a tree of life to all who take her in their hands, and happy is everyone who keeps her.

**¹⁹** The Lord by wisdom put in position the bases of the earth; by reason he put the heavens in their place.

**²⁰** By his knowledge the deep was parted, and dew came dropping from the skies.

**²¹** My son, keep good sense, and do not let wise purpose go from your eyes.

**²²** So they will be life for your soul, and grace for your neck.

**²³** Then you will go safely on your way, and your feet will have no cause for slipping.

**²⁴** When you take your rest you will have no fear, and on your bed sleep will be sweet to you.

**²⁵** Have no fear of sudden danger, or of the storm which will come on evil-doers:

**²⁶** For the Lord will be your hope, and will keep your foot from being taken in the net.

**²⁷** Do not keep back good from those who have a right to it, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.

**²⁸** Say not to your neighbour, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it by you at the time.

**²⁹** Do not make evil designs against your neighbour, when he is living with you without fear.

**³⁰** Do not take up a cause at law against a man for nothing, if he has done you no wrong.

**³¹** Have no envy of the violent man, or take any of his ways as an example.

**³²** For the wrong-hearted man is hated by the Lord, but he is a friend to the upright.

**³³** The curse of the Lord is on the house of the evil-doer, but his blessing is on the tent of the upright.

**³⁴** He makes sport of the men of pride, but he gives grace to the gentle-hearted.

**³⁵** The wise will have glory for their heritage, but shame will be the reward of the foolish.
