# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> The word about the valley of vision. Why have all your people gone up to the house-tops? 

<sup>2</sup> You, who are full of loud voices, a town of outcries, given up to joy; your dead men have not been put to the sword, or come to their death in war. 

<sup>3</sup> All your rulers ... have gone in flight; all your strong ones have gone far away. 

<sup>4</sup> For this cause I have said, Let your eyes be turned away from me in my bitter weeping; I will not be comforted for the wasting of the daughter of my people. 

<sup>5</sup> For it is a day of trouble and of crushing down and of destruction from the Lord, the Lord of armies, in the valley of vision; ... 

<sup>6</sup> And Elam was armed with arrows, and Aram came on horseback; and the breastplate of Kir was uncovered. 

<sup>7</sup> And your most fertile valleys were full of war-carriages, and the horsemen took up their positions in front of the town. 

<sup>8</sup> He took away the cover of Judah; and in that day you were looking with care at the store of arms in the house of the woods. 

<sup>9</sup> And you saw all the broken places in the wall of the town of David: and you got together the waters of the lower pool. 

<sup>10</sup> And you had the houses of Jerusalem numbered, pulling down the houses to make the wall stronger. 

<sup>11</sup> And you made a place between the two walls for storing the waters of the old pool: but you gave no thought to him who had done this, and were not looking to him by whom it had been purposed long before. 

<sup>12</sup> And in that day the Lord, the Lord of armies, was looking for weeping, and cries of sorrow, cutting off of the hair, and putting on the clothing of grief: 

<sup>13</sup> But in place of these there was joy and delight, oxen and sheep were being made ready for food, there was feasting and drinking: men said, Now is the time for food and wine, for tomorrow death comes. 

<sup>14</sup> And the Lord of armies said to me secretly, Truly, this sin will not be taken from you till your death, says the Lord, the Lord of armies. 

<sup>15</sup> The Lord, the Lord of armies, says, Go to this person in authority, this Shebna, who is over the house; who has made himself a resting-place on high, cutting out a place for himself in the rock, and say, 

<sup>16</sup> Who are you, and by what right have you made for yourself a resting-place here? 

<sup>17</sup> See, O strong man, the Lord will send you violently away, gripping you with force, 

<sup>18</sup> Twisting you round and round like a ball he will send you out into a wide country: there you will come to your end, and there will be the carriages of your pride, O shame of your lord's house! 

<sup>19</sup> And I will have you forced out of your place of authority, and pulled down from your position. 

<sup>20</sup> And in that day I will send for my servant, Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah: 

<sup>21</sup> And I will put your robe on him, and put your band about him, and I will give your authority into his hand: and he will be a father to the men of Jerusalem, and to the family of Judah. 

<sup>22</sup> And I will give the key of the family of David into his care; and what he keeps open will be shut by no one, and what he keeps shut no one will make open. 

<sup>23</sup> And I will put him like a nail in a safe place; and he will be for a seat of glory to his father's family. 

<sup>24</sup> And all the glory of his father's family will be hanging on him, all their offspring, every small vessel, even the cups and the basins. 

<sup>25</sup> In that day, says the Lord of armies, will the nail fixed in a safe place give way; and it will be cut down, and in its fall the weight hanging on it will be cut off, for the Lord has said it.
