# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: these are the sons which they had after the great flow of waters

<sup>2</sup> The sons of Japheth: Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.

<sup>3</sup> And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.

<sup>4</sup> And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, the Kittim and the Dodanim.

<sup>5</sup> From these came the nations of the sea-lands, with their different families and languages.

<sup>6</sup> And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.

<sup>7</sup> And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.

<sup>8</sup> And Cush was the father of Nimrod, who was the first of the great men of the earth.

<sup>9</sup> He was a very great bowman, so that there is a saying, Like Nimrod, a very great bowman.

<sup>10</sup> And at the first, his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

<sup>11</sup> From that land he went out into Assyria, building Nineveh with its wide streets and Calah,

<sup>12</sup> And Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which is a very great town.

<sup>13</sup> And Mizraim was the father of the Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim;

<sup>14</sup> And Pathrusim and Casluhim and Caphtorim, from whom came the Philistines.

<sup>15</sup> And Canaan was the father of Zidon, who was his oldest son, and Heth,

<sup>16</sup> And the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite,

<sup>17</sup> And the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite,

<sup>18</sup> And the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; after that the families of the Canaanites went far and wide in all directions;

<sup>19</sup> Their country stretching from Zidon to Gaza, in the direction of Gerar; and to Lasha, in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim.

<sup>20</sup> All these, with their different families, languages, lands, and nations, are the offspring of Ham.

<sup>21</sup> And Shem, the older brother of Japheth, the father of the children of Eber, had other sons in addition.

<sup>22</sup> These are the sons of Shem: Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.

<sup>23</sup> And the sons of Aram: Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.

<sup>24</sup> And Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.

<sup>25</sup> And Eber had two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, because in his time the peoples of the earth became separate; and his brother's name was Joktan.

<sup>26</sup> And Joktan was the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah

<sup>27</sup> And Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah

<sup>28</sup> And Obal and Abimael and Sheba

<sup>29</sup> And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.

<sup>30</sup> And their country was from Mesha, in the direction of Sephar, the mountain of the east.

<sup>31</sup> These, with their families and their languages and their lands and their nations, are the offspring of Shem.

<sup>32</sup> These are the families of the sons of Noah, in the order of their generations and their nations: from these came all the nations of the earth after the great flow of waters.
