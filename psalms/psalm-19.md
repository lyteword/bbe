# Psalm 19

To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.

<sup>1</sup> The heavens are sounding the glory of God; the arch of the sky makes clear the work of his hands.

<sup>2</sup> Day after day it sends out its word, and night after night it gives knowledge.

<sup>3</sup> There are no words or language; their voice makes no sound.

<sup>4</sup> Their line has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them has he put a tent for the sun,

<sup>5</sup> Who is like a newly married man coming from his bride-tent, and is glad like a strong runner starting on his way.

<sup>6</sup> His going out is from the end of the heaven, and his circle to the ends of it; there is nothing which is not open to his heat.

<sup>7</sup> The law of the Lord is good, giving new life to the soul: the witness of the Lord is certain, giving wisdom to the foolish.

<sup>8</sup> The orders of the Lord are right, making glad the heart: the rule of the Lord is holy, giving light to the eyes.

<sup>9</sup> The fear of the Lord is clean, and has no end; the decisions of the Lord are true and full of righteousness.

<sup>10</sup> More to be desired are they than gold, even than much shining gold; sweeter than the dropping honey.

<sup>11</sup> By them is your servant made conscious of danger, and in keeping them there is great reward.

<sup>12</sup> Who has full knowledge of his errors? make me clean from secret evil.

<sup>13</sup> Keep your servant back from sins of pride; let them not have rule over me: then will I be upright and free from great sin.

<sup>14</sup> Let the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing in your eyes, O Lord, my strength and my salvation.
