# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For the Lord, the Lord of armies, is about to take away from Jerusalem and from Judah all their support; their store of bread and of water; 

<sup>2</sup> The strong man and the man of war; the judge and the prophet; the man who has knowledge of secret arts, and the man who is wise because of his years; 

<sup>3</sup> The captain of fifty, and the man of high position, and the wise guide, and the wonder-worker, and he who makes use of secret powers. 

<sup>4</sup> And I will make children their chiefs, and foolish ones will have rule over them. 

<sup>5</sup> And the people will be crushed, every one by his neighbour; the young will be full of pride against the old, and those of low position will be lifted up against the noble. 

<sup>6</sup> When one man puts his hand on another in his father's house, and says, You have clothing, be our ruler and be responsible for us in our sad condition: 

<sup>7</sup> Then he will say with an oath, I will not be a helper, for in my house there is no bread or clothing: I will not let you make me a ruler of the people. 

<sup>8</sup> For Jerusalem has become feeble, and destruction has come on Judah, because their words and their acts are against the Lord, moving the eyes of his glory to wrath. 

<sup>9</sup> Their respect for a man's position is a witness against them; and their sin is open to the view of all; like that of Sodom, it is not covered. A curse on their soul! for the measure of their sin is full. 

<sup>10</sup> Happy is the upright man! for he will have joy of the fruit of his ways. 

<sup>11</sup> Unhappy is the sinner! for the reward of his evil doings will come on him. 

<sup>12</sup> As for my people, their ruler is acting like a child, and those who have authority over them are women. O my people, your guides are the cause of your wandering, turning your footsteps out of the right way. 

<sup>13</sup> The Lord is ready to take up his cause against his people, and is about to come forward as their judge. 

<sup>14</sup> The Lord comes to be the judge of their responsible men and of their rulers: it is you who have made waste the vine-garden, and in your houses is the property of the poor which you have taken by force. 

<sup>15</sup> By what right are you crushing my people, and putting a bitter yoke on the necks of the poor? This is the word of the Lord, the Lord of armies. 

<sup>16</sup> Again, the Lord has said, Because the daughters of Zion are full of pride, and go with outstretched necks and wandering eyes, with their foot-chains sounding when they go: 

<sup>17</sup> The Lord will send disease on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will let their secret parts be seen. 

<sup>18</sup> In that day the Lord will take away the glory of their foot-rings, and their sun-jewels, and their moon-ornaments, 

<sup>19</sup> The ear-rings, and the chains, and the delicate clothing, 

<sup>20</sup> The head-bands, and the arm-chains, and the worked bands, and the perfume-boxes, and the jewels with secret powers, 

<sup>21</sup> The rings, and the nose-jewels, 

<sup>22</sup> The feast-day dresses, and the robes, and the wide skirts, and the handbags, 

<sup>23</sup> The looking-glasses, and the fair linen, and the high head-dresses, and the veils. 

<sup>24</sup> And in the place of sweet spices will be an evil smell, and for a fair band a thick cord; for a well-dressed head there will be the cutting-off of the hair, and for a beautiful robe there will be the clothing of sorrow; the mark of the prisoner in place of the ornaments of the free. 

<sup>25</sup> Your men will be put to the sword, and your men of war will come to destruction in the fight. 

<sup>26</sup> And in the public places of her towns will be sorrow and weeping; and she will be seated on the earth, waste and uncovered.
