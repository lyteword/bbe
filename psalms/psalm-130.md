# Psalm 130

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. Out of the deep have I sent up my cry to you, O Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> Lord, let my voice come before you: let your ears be awake to the voice of my prayer. 

<sup>3</sup> O Jah, if you took note of every sin, who would go free? 

<sup>4</sup> But there is forgiveness with you, so that you may be feared. 

<sup>5</sup> I am waiting for the Lord, my soul is waiting for him, and my hope is in his word. 

<sup>6</sup> My soul is watching for the Lord more than those who are watching for the morning; yes, more than the watchers for the morning. 

<sup>7</sup> O Israel, have hope in the Lord; for with the Lord is mercy and full salvation. 

<sup>8</sup> And he will make Israel free from all his sins.
