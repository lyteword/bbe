# Psalm 132

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the going up. Lord, give thought to David, and to all his troubles; 

<sup>2</sup> How he made an oath to the Lord, and gave his word to the great God of Jacob, saying, 

<sup>3</sup> Truly, I will not come into my house, or go to my bed, 

<sup>4</sup> I will not give sleep to my eyes, or rest to my eyeballs, 

<sup>5</sup> Till I have got a place for the Lord, a resting-place for the great God of Jacob. 

<sup>6</sup> We had news of it at Ephrathah: we came to it in the fields of the wood. 

<sup>7</sup> Let us go into his tent; let us give worship at his feet. 

<sup>8</sup> Come back, O Lord, to your resting-place; you and the ark of your strength. 

<sup>9</sup> Let your priests be clothed with righteousness; and let your saints give cries of joy. 

<sup>10</sup> Because of your servant David, do not give up your king. 

<sup>11</sup> The Lord gave a true oath to David, which he will not take back, saying, I will give your kingdom to the fruit of your body. 

<sup>12</sup> If your children keep my word, and the teachings which I will give them, their children will be rulers of your kingdom for ever. 

<sup>13</sup> For the Lord's heart is on Zion, desiring it for his resting-place. 

<sup>14</sup> This is my rest for ever: here will I ever be; for this is my desire. 

<sup>15</sup> My blessing will be on her food; and her poor will be full of bread. 

<sup>16</sup> Her priests will be clothed with salvation; and her saints will give cries of joy. 

<sup>17</sup> There I will make the horn of David fertile: I have made ready a light for my king. 

<sup>18</sup> His haters will be clothed with shame; but I will make his crown shining.
