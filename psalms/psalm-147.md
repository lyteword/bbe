# Psalm 147

<sup>1</sup> Give praise to the Lord; for it is good to make melody to our God; praise is pleasing and beautiful.

<sup>2</sup> The Lord is building up Jerusalem; he makes all the outlaws of Israel come together.

<sup>3</sup> He makes the broken-hearted well, and puts oil on their wounds.

<sup>4</sup> He sees the number of the stars; he gives them all their names.

<sup>5</sup> Great is our Lord, and great his power; there is no limit to his wisdom.

<sup>6</sup> The Lord gives help to the poor in spirit; but he sends sinners down in shame.

<sup>7</sup> Make songs of praise to the Lord; make melody to our God with instruments of music.

<sup>8</sup> By his hand the heaven is covered with clouds and rain is stored up for the earth; he makes the grass tall on the mountains.

<sup>9</sup> He gives food to every beast, and to the young ravens in answer to their cry.

<sup>10</sup> He has no delight in the strength of a horse; he takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.

<sup>11</sup> The Lord takes pleasure in his worshippers, and in those whose hope is in his mercy.

<sup>12</sup> Give praise to the Lord, O Jerusalem; give praise to your God, O Zion.

<sup>13</sup> He has made strong the iron bands of your doors; he has sent blessings on your children inside your walls.

<sup>14</sup> He gives peace in all your land, making your stores full of fat grain.

<sup>15</sup> He sends out his orders to the earth; his word goes out quickly.

<sup>16</sup> He gives snow like wool; he sends out ice-drops like dust.

<sup>17</sup> He sends down ice like raindrops: water is made hard by his cold.

<sup>18</sup> At the outgoing of his word, the ice is turned to water; when he sends out his wind, there is a flowing of waters.

<sup>19</sup> He makes his word clear to Jacob, teaching Israel his laws and his decisions.

<sup>20</sup> He has not done these things for any other nation: and as for his laws, they have no knowledge of them. Let the Lord be praised.
