# Psalm 108

<sup>1</sup> A Song. A Psalm. Of David. O God, my heart is fixed; I will make songs and melody, even with my glory. 

<sup>2</sup> Give out your sounds, O corded instruments: the dawn will be awaking with my song. 

<sup>3</sup> I will give you praise, O Lord, among the peoples; I will make melody to you among the nations. 

<sup>4</sup> For your mercy is higher than the heavens: and your unchanging faith than the clouds. 

<sup>5</sup> Be lifted up, O God, higher than the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth. 

<sup>6</sup> Let your right hand be stretched out for salvation, and give me an answer, so that your loved ones may be safe from danger. 

<sup>7</sup> This is the word of the holy God: I will be glad; I will make Shechem a heritage, measuring out the valley of Succoth. 

<sup>8</sup> Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver; 

<sup>9</sup> Moab is my washpot; on Edom is the resting-place of my shoe; over Philistia will I send out a glad cry. 

<sup>10</sup> Who will take me into the strong town? who will be my guide into Edom? 

<sup>11</sup> Have you not sent us away from you, O God? and you go not out with our armies. 

<sup>12</sup> Give us help in our trouble; for there is no help in man. 

<sup>13</sup> With God we will do great things; for by him will our haters be crushed underfoot.
