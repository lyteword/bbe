# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The song of Songs, which is Solomon's. 

<sup>2</sup> Let him give me the kisses of his mouth: for his love is better than wine. 

<sup>3</sup> Sweet is the smell of your perfumes; your name is as perfume running out; so the young girls give you their love. 

<sup>4</sup> Take me to you, and we will go after you: the king has taken me into his house. We will be glad and full of joy in you, we will give more thought to your love than to wine: rightly are they your lovers. 

<sup>5</sup> I am dark, but fair of form, O daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. 

<sup>6</sup> Let not your eyes be turned on me, because I am dark, because I was looked on by the sun; my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vine-gardens; but my vine-garden I have not kept. 

<sup>7</sup> Say, O love of my soul, where you give food to your flock, and where you make them take their rest in the heat of the day; why have I to be as one wandering by the flocks of your friends? 

<sup>8</sup> If you have not knowledge, O most beautiful among women, go on your way in the footsteps of the flock, and give your young goats food by the tents of the keepers. 

<sup>9</sup> I have made a comparison of you, O my love, to a horse in Pharaoh's carriages. 

<sup>10</sup> Your face is a delight with rings of hair, your neck with chains of jewels. 

<sup>11</sup> We will make you chains of gold with ornaments of silver. 

<sup>12</sup> While the king is seated at his table, my spices send out their perfume. 

<sup>13</sup> As a bag of myrrh is my well-loved one to me, when he is at rest all night between my breasts. 

<sup>14</sup> My love is to me as a branch of the cypress-tree in the vine-gardens of En-gedi. 

<sup>15</sup> See, you are fair, my love, you are fair; you have the eyes of a dove. 

<sup>16</sup> See, you are fair, my loved one, and a pleasure; our bed is green. 

<sup>17</sup> Cedar-trees are the pillars of our house; and our boards are made of fir-trees.
