# Psalm 88

A Song. A Psalm. Of the sons of Korah. To the chief music-maker; put to Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil. Of Heman the Ezrahite.

**¹** O Lord, God of my salvation, I have been crying to you for help by day and by night:

**²** Let my prayer come before you; give ear to my cry:

**³** For my soul is full of evils, and my life has come near to the underworld.

**⁴** I am numbered among those who go down into the earth; I have become like a man for whom there is no help:

**⁵** My soul is among the dead, like those in the underworld, to whom you give no more thought; for they are cut off from your care.

**⁶** You have put me in the lowest deep, even in dark places.

**⁷** The weight of your wrath is crushing me, all your waves have overcome me. (Selah.)

**⁸** You have sent my friends far away from me; you have made me a disgusting thing in their eyes: I am shut up, and not able to come out.

**⁹** My eyes are wasting away because of my trouble: Lord, my cry has gone up to you every day, my hands are stretched out to you.

**¹⁰** Will you do works of wonder for the dead? will the shades come back to give you praise? (Selah.)

**¹¹** Will the story of your mercy be given in the house of the dead? will news of your faith come to the place of destruction?

**¹²** May there be knowledge of your wonders in the dark? or of your righteousness where memory is dead?

**¹³** But to you did I send up my cry, O Lord; in the morning my prayer came before you.

**¹⁴** Lord, why have you sent away my soul? why is your face covered from me?

**¹⁵** I have been troubled and in fear of death from the time when I was young; your wrath is hard on me, and I have no strength.

**¹⁶** The heat of your wrath has gone over me; I am broken by your cruel punishments.

**¹⁷** They are round me all the day like water; they have made a circle about me.

**¹⁸** You have sent my friends and lovers far from me; I am gone from the memory of those who are dear to me.
