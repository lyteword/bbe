# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> And there came together to him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, 

<sup>2</sup> And had seen that some of his disciples took their bread with unclean, that is, unwashed, hands. 

<sup>3</sup> Now the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not take food without washing their hands with care, keeping the old rule which has been handed down to them: 

<sup>4</sup> And when they come from the market-place, they take no food till their hands are washed; and a number of other orders there are, which have been handed down to them to keep â€” washings of cups and pots and brass vessels. 

<sup>5</sup> And the Pharisees and the scribes put the question to him, Why do your disciples not keep the rules of the fathers, but take their bread with unwashed hands? 

<sup>6</sup> And he said, Well did Isaiah say of you, you false ones: These people give me honour with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 

<sup>7</sup> But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules of men. 

<sup>8</sup> For, turning away from the law of God, you keep the rules of men. 

<sup>9</sup> And he said to them, Truly you put on one side the law of God, so that you may keep the rules which have been handed down to you. 

<sup>10</sup> For Moses said, Give honour to your father and mother, and, He who says evil of father or mother, let him have the punishment of death: 

<sup>11</sup> But you say, If a man says to his father or his mother, That by which you might have had profit from me is Corban, that is to say, Given to God, 

<sup>12</sup> You no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother; 

<sup>13</sup> Making the word of God of no effect by your rule, which you have given: and a number of other such things you do. 

<sup>14</sup> And turning to the people again, he said to them, Give ear to me all of you, and let my words be clear to you: 

<sup>15</sup> There is nothing outside the man which, going into him, is able to make him unclean: but the things which come out of the man are those which make the man unclean.
